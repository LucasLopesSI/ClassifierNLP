"Social Sciences","Synchrony and diachrony or statics and dynamics within social theory are terms that refer to a distinction emerging out of the work of Levi Strauss who inherited it from the linguistics of Ferdinand de Saussure The former slices moments of time for analysis thus it is an analysis of static social reality Diachrony on the other hand attempts to analyse dynamic sequences Following Saussure synchrony would refer to social phenomena as a static concept like a language while diachrony would refer to unfolding processes like actual speech In Anthony Giddens' introduction to Central Problems in Social Theory he states that,in order to show the interdependence of action and structure we must grasp the time space relations inherent in the constitution of all social interactionAnd like structure and agency time is integral to discussion of social reproduction In terms of sociology historical sociology is often better positioned to analyse social life as diachronic while survey research takes a snapshot of social life and is thus better equipped to understand social life as synchronized Some argue that the synchrony of social structure is a methodological perspective rather than an ontological claim Nonetheless the problem for theory is how to integrate the two manners of recording and thinking about social data"

"Clinical Medicine","The surface tension of a watery surface the water air interface tends to make that surface shrink When that surface is curved as it is in the alveoli of the lungs the shrinkage of the surface decreases the diameter of the alveoli The more acute the curvature of the water air interface the greater the tendency for the alveolus to collapse This has three effects Firstly the surface tension inside the alveoli resists expansion of the alveoli during inhalation ie it makes the lung stiff or non compliant Surfactant reduces the surface tension and therefore makes the lungs more compliant or less stiff than if it were not there Secondly the diameters of the alveoli increase and decrease during the breathing cycle This means that the alveoli have a greater tendency to collapse ie cause atelectasis at the end of exhalation that at the end of inhalation Since surfactant floats on the watery surface its molecules are more tightly packed together when the alveoli shrink during exhalation This causes them to have a greater surface tension lowering effect when the alveoli are small than when they are large as at the end of inhalation when the surfactant molecules are more widely spaced The tendency for the alveoli to collapse is therefore almost the same at the end of exhalation as at the end of inhalation Thirdly the surface tension of the curved watery layer lining the alveoli tends to draw water from the lung tissues into the alveoli Surfactant reduces this danger to negligible levels and keeps the alveoli dry"

"Information & Communication Technologies","Voice over Internet Protocol VoIP allows data packets to be used for synchronous voice communications The data packets are marked as voice type packets and can be prioritized by the network administrators so that the real time synchronous conversation is less subject to contention with other types of data traffic which can be delayed ie file transfer or email or buffered in advance ie audio and video without detriment That prioritization is fine when the network has sufficient capacity for all the VoIP calls taking place at the same time and the network is enabled for prioritization ie a private corporate style network but the Internet is not generally managed in this way and so there can be a big difference in the quality of VoIP calls over a private network and over the public Internet"

"Biomedical Research","Two monosaccharides can be joined together by a glycosidic or ether bond into a disaccharide through a dehydration reaction during which a molecule of water is released The reverse reaction in which the glycosidic bond of a disaccharide is broken into two monosaccharides is termed hydrolysis The best known disaccharide is sucrose or ordinary sugar which consists of a glucose molecule and a fructose molecule joined together Another important disaccharide is lactose found in milk consisting of a glucose molecule and a galactose molecule Lactose may be hydrolysed by lactase and deficiency in this enzyme results in lactose intolerance"
"Biomedical Research","Recent findings have confirmed important examples of heritable changes that cannot be explained by direct agency of the DNA molecule These phenomena are classed as epigenetic inheritance systems that are causally or independently evolving over genes Research into modes and mechanisms of epigenetic inheritance is still in its scientific infancy however this area of research has attracted much recent activity as it broadens the scope of heritability and evolutionary biology in general DNA methylation marking chromatin self sustaining metabolic loops gene silencing by RNA interference and the three dimensional conformation of proteins such as prions are areas where epigenetic inheritance systems have been discovered at the organismic level Heritability may also occur at even larger scales For example ecological inheritance through the process of niche construction is defined by the regular and repeated activities of organisms in their environment This generates a legacy of effect that modifies and feeds back into the selection regime of subsequent generations Descendants inherit genes plus environmental characteristics generated by the ecological actions of ancestors Other examples of heritability in evolution that are not under the direct control of genes include the inheritance of cultural traits group heritability and symbiogenesis These examples of heritability that operate above the gene are covered broadly under the title of multilevel or hierarchical selection which has been a subject of intense debate in the history of evolutionary science"

"Biomedical Research","Normally a cell divides only in response to signals called growth factors and stops growing once in contact with surrounding cells and in response to growth inhibitory signals It usually then divides a limited number of times and dies staying within the epithelium where it is unable to migrate to other organs To become a cancer cell a cell has to accumulate mutations in a number of genes three to seven A cancer cell can divide without growth factor and ignores inhibitory signals Also it is immortal and can grow indefinitely even after it makes contact with neighboring cells It may escape from the epithelium and ultimately from the primary tumor Then the escaped cell can cross the endothelium of a blood vessel and get transported by the bloodstream to colonize a new organ forming deadly metastasis Although there are some genetic predispositions in a small fraction of cancers the major fraction is due to a set of new genetic mutations that originally appear and accumulate in one or a small number of cells that will divide to form the tumor and are not transmitted to the progeny somatic mutations The most frequent mutations are a loss of function of p protein a tumor suppressor or in the p pathway and gain of function mutations in the Ras proteins or in other oncogenes"
"Biomedical Research","Next generation sequencing or high throughput sequencing came about due to the ever increasing demand for low cost sequencing These sequencing technologies allow the production of potentially millions of sequences concurrently The large amount of sequence data available has created the field of genomics research that uses computational tools to search for and analyze patterns in the full genomes of organisms Genomics can also be considered a subfield of bioinformatics which uses computational approaches to analyze large sets of biological data A common problem to these fields of research is how to manage and share data that deals with human subject and personally identifiable information"

"Engineering","The force acts on the charged particles themselves hence charge has a tendency to spread itself as evenly as possible over a conducting surface The magnitude of the electromagnetic force whether attractive or repulsive is given by Coulomb's law which relates the force to the product of the charges and has an inverse square relation to the distance between them The electromagnetic force is very strong second only in strength to the strong interaction but unlike that force it operates over all distances In comparison with the much weaker gravitational force the electromagnetic force pushing two electrons apart is times that of the gravitational attraction pulling them together"

"Engineering","The automation of vehicles could prove to have a substantial impact on the environment although the nature of this impact could be beneficial or harmful depending on several factors Because automated vehicles are much less likely to get into accidents compared to human driven vehicles some precautions built into current models such as anti lock brakes or laminated glass would not be required for self driving versions Removing these safety features would also significantly reduce the weight of the vehicle thus increasing fuel economy and reducing emissions per mile Self driving vehicles are also more precise with regard to acceleration and breaking and this could contribute to reduced emissions Self driving cars could also potentially utilize fuel efficient features such as route mapping that is able to calculate and take the most efficient routes Despite this potential to reduce emissions some researchers theorize that an increase of production of self driving cars could lead to a boom of vehicle ownership and use This boom could potentially negate any environmental benefits of self driving cars if a large enough number of people begin driving personal vehicles more frequently"

"Mathematics & Statistics","In the United States topics are usually integrated throughout elementary school up to the eighth grade Beginning with high school level courses topics are usually separated so that one year a student focuses entirely on algebra the next year entirely on geometry and then another year of algebra and later an optional fifth year of analysis calculus The one exception in the American high school curriculum is the fourth year of math typically referred to as precalculus which usually integrates algebra analysis trigonometry and geometry topics Statistics may be integrated into all the courses or presented as a separate course"
"Mathematics & Statistics","New York State began using integrated math curricula in the s but recently returned to a traditional curriculum A few other localities in the United States have also tried such integrated curricula including Georgia which mandated them in but subsequently made them optional More recently a few other states have mandated that all districts change to integrated curricula including North Carolina West Virginia and Utah Some districts in other states including California have either switched or are considering switching to an integrated curriculum"
"Mathematics & Statistics","Under the Common Core Standards adopted by most states in high school mathematics may be taught using either a traditional American approach or an integrated curriculum The only difference would be the order in which the topics are taught Supporters of using integrated curricula in the United States believe that students will be able to see the connections between algebra and geometry better in an integrated curriculum"
"Mathematics & Statistics","General mathematics is another term for a mathematics course organized around different branches of mathematics with topics arranged according to the main objective of the course When applied to primary education the term general mathematics may encompass mathematical concepts more complex than basic arithmetic like number notation addition and multiplication tables fractions and related operations measurement units When used in context of higher education the term may encompass mathematical terminology and concepts finding and applying appropriate techniques to solve routine problems interpreting and representing practical information given in various forms interpreting and using mathematical models and constructing mathematical arguments to solve familiar and unfamiliar problems"

"Mathematics & Statistics","Statistics is the discipline that concerns the collection organization analysis interpretation and presentation of data In applying statistics to a scientific industrial or social problem it is conventional to begin with a statistical population or a statistical model to be studied Populations can be diverse groups of people or objects such asall people living in a countryorevery atom composing a crystalStatistics deals with every aspect of data including the planning of data collection in terms of the design of surveys and experiments See glossary of probability and statistics"
"Mathematics & Statistics","When census data cannot be collected statisticians collect data by developing specific experiment designs and survey samples Representative sampling assures that inferences and conclusions can reasonably extend from the sample to the population as a whole An experimental study involves taking measurements of the system under study manipulating the system and then taking additional measurements using the same procedure to determine if the manipulation has modified the values of the measurements In contrast an observational study does not involve experimental manipulation"
"Mathematics & Statistics","Two main statistical methods are used in data analysis descriptive statistics which summarize data from a sample using indexes such as the mean or standard deviation and inferential statistics which draw conclusions from data that are subject to random variation eg observational errors sampling variation Descriptive statistics are most often concerned with two sets of properties of a distribution sample or population central tendency or location seeks to characterize the distribution's central or typical value while dispersion or variability characterizes the extent to which members of the distribution depart from its center and each other Inferences on mathematical statistics are made under the framework of probability theory which deals with the analysis of random phenomena"
"Mathematics & Statistics","A standard statistical procedure involves the test of the relationship between two statistical data sets or a data set and synthetic data drawn from an idealized model A hypothesis is proposed for the statistical relationship between the two data sets and this is compared as an alternative to an idealized null hypothesis of no relationship between two data sets Rejecting or disproving the null hypothesis is done using statistical tests that quantify the sense in which the null can be proven false given the data that are used in the test Working from a null hypothesis two basic forms of error are recognized Type I errors null hypothesis is falsely rejected giving afalse positiveand Type II errors null hypothesis fails to be rejected and an actual relationship between populations is missed giving afalse negativeMultiple problems have come to be associated with this framework ranging from obtaining a sufficient sample size to specifying an adequate null hypothesiscitation needed"
"Mathematics & Statistics","Measurement processes that generate statistical data are also subject to error Many of these errors are classified as random noise or systematic bias but other types of errors eg blunder such as when an analyst reports incorrect units can also occur The presence of missing data or censoring may result in biased estimates and specific techniques have been developed to address these problems"
"Mathematics & Statistics","The earliest writings on probability and statistics statistical methods drawing from probability theory date back to Arab mathematicians and cryptographers notably Al Khalil and Al Kindi In the th century statistics also started to draw heavily from calculus In more recent years statistics has relied more on statistical software to produce these tests such as descriptive analysis"

"Mathematics & Statistics","Statistics is a mathematical body of science that pertains to the collection analysis interpretation or explanation and presentation of data or as a branch of mathematics Some consider statistics to be a distinct mathematical science rather than a branch of mathematics While many scientific investigations make use of data statistics is concerned with the use of data in the context of uncertainty and decision making in the face of uncertainty"
"Mathematics & Statistics","In applying statistics to a problem it is common practice to start with a population or process to be studied Populations can be diverse topics such asall people living in a countryorevery atom composing a crystalIdeally statisticians compile data about the entire population an operation called census This may be organized by governmental statistical institutes Descriptive statistics can be used to summarize the population data Numerical descriptors include mean and standard deviation for continuous data types like income while frequency and percentage are more useful in terms of describing categorical data like education"
"Mathematics & Statistics","When a census is not feasible a chosen subset of the population called a sample is studied Once a sample that is representative of the population is determined data is collected for the sample members in an observational or experimental setting Again descriptive statistics can be used to summarize the sample data However the drawing of the sample has been subject to an element of randomness hence the established numerical descriptors from the sample are also due to uncertainty To still draw meaningful conclusions about the entire population inferential statistics is needed It uses patterns in the sample data to draw inferences about the population represented accounting for randomness These inferences may take the form of answering yes no questions about the data hypothesis testing estimating numerical characteristics of the data estimation describing associations within the data correlation and modeling relationships within the data for example using regression analysis Inference can extend to forecasting prediction and estimation of unobserved values either in or associated with the population being studied it can include extrapolation and interpolation of time series or spatial data and can also include data mining"

"Mathematics & Statistics","The earliest European writing on statistics dates back to with the publication of Natural and Political Observations upon the Bills of Mortality by John Graunt Early applications of statistical thinking revolved around the needs of states to base policy on demographic and economic data hence its stat etymology The scope of the discipline of statistics broadened in the early th century to include the collection and analysis of data in general Today statistics is widely employed in government business and natural and social sciences"
"Mathematics & Statistics","The mathematical foundations of modern statistics were laid in the th century with the development of the probability theory by Gerolamo Cardano Blaise Pascal and Pierre de Fermat Mathematical probability theory arose from the study of games of chance although the concept of probability was already examined in medieval law and by philosophers such as Juan Caramuel The method of least squares was first described by Adrien Marie Legendre in"
"Mathematics & Statistics","The modern field of statistics emerged in the late th and early th century in three stages The first wave at the turn of the century was led by the work of Francis Galton and Karl Pearson who transformed statistics into a rigorous mathematical discipline used for analysis not just in science but in industry and politics as well Galton's contributions included introducing the concepts of standard deviation correlation regression analysis and the application of these methods to the study of the variety of human characteristics height weight eyelash length among others Pearson developed the Pearson product moment correlation coefficient defined as a product moment the method of moments for the fitting of distributions to samples and the Pearson distribution among many other things Galton and Pearson founded Biometrika as the first journal of mathematical statistics and biostatistics then called biometry and the latter founded the world's first university statistics department at University College London"
"Mathematics & Statistics","Ronald Fisher coined the term null hypothesis during the Lady tasting tea experiment whichis never proved or established but is possibly disproved in the course of experimentation"
"Mathematics & Statistics","The second wave of the s and s was initiated by William Sealy Gosset and reached its culmination in the insights of Ronald Fisher who wrote the textbooks that were to define the academic discipline in universities around the world Fisher's most important publications were his seminal paper The Correlation between Relatives on the Supposition of Mendelian Inheritance which was the first to use the statistical term variance his classic work Statistical Methods for Research Workers and his The Design of Experiments where he developed rigorous design of experiments models He originated the concepts of sufficiency ancillary statistics Fisher's linear discriminator and Fisher information In his book The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection he applied statistics to various biological concepts such as Fisher's principle which A W F Edwards calledprobably the most celebrated argument in evolutionary biologyand Fisherian runaway a concept in sexual selection about a positive feedback runaway affect found in evolution"
"Mathematics & Statistics","The final wave which mainly saw the refinement and expansion of earlier developments emerged from the collaborative work between Egon Pearson and Jerzy Neyman in the s They introduced the concepts ofType IIerror power of a test and confidence intervals Jerzy Neyman in showed that stratified random sampling was in general a better method of estimation than purposive quota sampling"
"Mathematics & Statistics","Today statistical methods are applied in all fields that involve decision making for making accurate inferences from a collated body of data and for making decisions in the face of uncertainty based on statistical methodology The use of modern computers has expedited large scale statistical computations and has also made possible new methods that are impractical to perform manually Statistics continues to be an area of active research for example on the problem of how to analyze big data"
"Mathematics & Statistics","When full census data cannot be collected statisticians collect sample data by developing specific experiment designs and survey samples Statistics itself also provides tools for prediction and forecasting through statistical models The idea of making inferences based on sampled data began around the mid s in connection with estimating populations and developing precursors of life insurance"
"Mathematics & Statistics","To use a sample as a guide to an entire population it is important that it truly represents the overall population Representative sampling assures that inferences and conclusions can safely extend from the sample to the population as a whole A major problem lies in determining the extent that the sample chosen is actually representative Statistics offers methods to estimate and correct for any bias within the sample and data collection procedures There are also methods of experimental design for experiments that can lessen these issues at the outset of a study strengthening its capability to discern truths about the population"
"Mathematics & Statistics","Sampling theory is part of the mathematical discipline of probability theory Probability is used in mathematical statistics to study the sampling distributions of sample statistics and more generally the properties of statistical procedures The use of any statistical method is valid when the system or population under consideration satisfies the assumptions of the method The difference in point of view between classic probability theory and sampling theory is roughly that probability theory starts from the given parameters of a total population to deduce probabilities that pertain to samples Statistical inference however moves in the opposite direction inductively inferring from samples to the parameters of a larger or total population"
"Mathematics & Statistics","A common goal for a statistical research project is to investigate causality and in particular to draw a conclusion on the effect of changes in the values of predictors or independent variables on dependent variables There are two major types of causal statistical studies experimental studies and observational studies In both types of studies the effect of differences of an independent variable or variables on the behavior of the dependent variable are observed The difference between the two types lies in how the study is actually conducted Each can be very effective An experimental study involves taking measurements of the system under study manipulating the system and then taking additional measurements using the same procedure to determine if the manipulation has modified the values of the measurements In contrast an observational study does not involve experimental manipulation Instead data are gathered and correlations between predictors and response are investigated While the tools of data analysis work best on data from randomized studies they are also applied to other kinds of data like natural experiments and observational studies for which a statistician would use a modified more structured estimation method eg Difference in differences estimation and instrumental variables among many others that produce consistent estimators"
"Mathematics & Statistics","Planning the research including finding the number of replicates of the study using the following information preliminary estimates regarding the size of treatment effects alternative hypotheses and the estimated experimental variability Consideration of the selection of experimental subjects and the ethics of research is necessary Statisticians recommend that experiments compare at least one new treatment with a standard treatment or control to allow an unbiased estimate of the difference in treatment effects"
"Mathematics & Statistics","Design of experiments using blocking to reduce the influence of confounding variables and randomized assignment of treatments to subjects to allow unbiased estimates of treatment effects and experimental error At this stage the experimenters and statisticians write the experimental protocol that will guide the performance of the experiment and which specifies the primary analysis of the experimental data"

"Mathematics & Statistics","Further examining the data set in secondary analyses to suggest new hypotheses for future study"
"Mathematics & Statistics","Experiments on human behavior have special concerns The famous Hawthorne study examined changes to the working environment at the Hawthorne plant of the Western Electric Company The researchers were interested in determining whether increased illumination would increase the productivity of the assembly line workers The researchers first measured the productivity in the plant then modified the illumination in an area of the plant and checked if the changes in illumination affected productivity It turned out that productivity indeed improved under the experimental conditions However the study is heavily criticized today for errors in experimental procedures specifically for the lack of a control group and blindness The Hawthorne effect refers to finding that an outcome in this case worker productivity changed due to observation itself Those in the Hawthorne study became more productive not because the lighting was changed but because they were being observed"
"Mathematics & Statistics","An example of an observational study is one that explores the association between smoking and lung cancer This type of study typically uses a survey to collect observations about the area of interest and then performs statistical analysis In this case the researchers would collect observations of both smokers and non smokers perhaps through a cohort study and then look for the number of cases of lung cancer in each group A case control study is another type of observational study in which people with and without the outcome of interest eg lung cancer are invited to participate and their exposure histories are collected"
"Mathematics & Statistics","Main articles Statistical data type and Levels of measurement"
"Mathematics & Statistics","Various attempts have been made to produce a taxonomy of levels of measurement The psychophysicist Stanley Smith Stevens defined nominal ordinal interval and ratio scales Nominal measurements do not have meaningful rank order among values and permit any one to one injective transformation Ordinal measurements have imprecise differences between consecutive values but have a meaningful order to those values and permit any order preserving transformation Interval measurements have meaningful distances between measurements defined but the zero value is arbitrary as in the case with longitude and temperature measurements in Celsius or Fahrenheit and permit any linear transformation Ratio measurements have both a meaningful zero value and the distances between different measurements defined and permit any rescaling transformation"
"Mathematics & Statistics","Because variables conforming only to nominal or ordinal measurements cannot be reasonably measured numerically sometimes they are grouped together as categorical variables whereas ratio and interval measurements are grouped together as quantitative variables which can be either discrete or continuous due to their numerical nature Such distinctions can often be loosely correlated with data type in computer science in that dichotomous categorical variables may be represented with the Boolean data type polytomous categorical variables with arbitrarily assigned integers in the integral data type and continuous variables with the real data type involving floating point computation But the mapping of computer science data types to statistical data types depends on which categorization of the latter is being implemented"
"Mathematics & Statistics","Other categorizations have been proposed For example Mosteller and Tukey distinguished grades ranks counted fractions counts amounts and balances Nelder described continuous counts continuous ratios count ratios and categorical modes of data See also Chrisman van den Berg"
"Mathematics & Statistics","The issue of whether or not it is appropriate to apply different kinds of statistical methods to data obtained from different kinds of measurement procedures is complicated by issues concerning the transformation of variables and the precise interpretation of research questionsThe relationship between the data and what they describe merely reflects the fact that certain kinds of statistical statements may have truth values which are not invariant under some transformations Whether or not a transformation is sensible to contemplate depends on the question one is trying to answerHand p"
"Mathematics & Statistics","A descriptive statistic in the count noun sense is a summary statistic that quantitatively describes or summarizes features of a collection of information while descriptive statistics in the mass noun sense is the process of using and analyzing those statistics Descriptive statistics is distinguished from inferential statistics or inductive statistics in that descriptive statistics aims to summarize a sample rather than use the data to learn about the population that the sample of data is thought to represent"
"Mathematics & Statistics","Statistical inference is the process of using data analysis to deduce properties of an underlying probability distribution Inferential statistical analysis infers properties of a population for example by testing hypotheses and deriving estimates It is assumed that the observed data set is sampled from a larger population Inferential statistics can be contrasted with descriptive statistics Descriptive statistics is solely concerned with properties of the observed data and it does not rest on the assumption that the data come from a larger population"
"Mathematics & Statistics","Consider independent identically distributed IID random variables with a given probability distribution standard statistical inference and estimation theory defines a random sample as the random vector given by the column vector of these IID variables The population being examined is described by a probability distribution that may have unknown parameters"
"Mathematics & Statistics","A statistic is a random variable that is a function of the random sample but not a function of unknown parameters The probability distribution of the statistic though may have unknown parameters"
"Mathematics & Statistics","Consider now a function of the unknown parameter an estimator is a statistic used to estimate such function Commonly used estimators include sample mean unbiased sample variance and sample covariance"
"Mathematics & Statistics","A random variable that is a function of the random sample and of the unknown parameter but whose probability distribution does not depend on the unknown parameter is called a pivotal quantity or pivot Widely used pivots include the z score the chi square statistic and Student's t value"
"Mathematics & Statistics","Between two estimators of a given parameter the one with lower mean squared error is said to be more efficient Furthermore an estimator is said to be unbiased if its expected value is equal to the true value of the unknown parameter being estimated and asymptotically unbiased if its expected value converges at the limit to the true value of such parameter"
"Mathematics & Statistics","Other desirable properties for estimators include UMVUE estimators that have the lowest variance for all possible values of the parameter to be estimated this is usually an easier property to verify than efficiency and consistent estimators which converges in probability to the true value of such parameter"
"Mathematics & Statistics","This still leaves the question of how to obtain estimators in a given situation and carry the computation several methods have been proposed the method of moments the maximum likelihood method the least squares method and the more recent method of estimating equations"
"Mathematics & Statistics","Interpretation of statistical information can often involve the development of a null hypothesis which is usually but not necessarily that no relationship exists among variables or that no change occurred over time"
"Mathematics & Statistics","The best illustration for a novice is the predicament encountered by a criminal trial The null hypothesis H asserts that the defendant is innocent whereas the alternative hypothesis H asserts that the defendant is guilty The indictment comes because of suspicion of the guilt The H status quo stands in opposition to H and is maintained unless H is supported by evidencebeyond a reasonable doubtHowever,failure to reject Hin this case does not imply innocence but merely that the evidence was insufficient to convict So the jury does not necessarily accept H but fails to reject H While one can notprovea null hypothesis one can test how close it is to being true with a power test which tests for type II errors"
"Mathematics & Statistics","What statisticians call an alternative hypothesis is simply a hypothesis that contradicts the null hypothesis"
"Mathematics & Statistics","Working from a null hypothesis two basic forms of error are recognized"
"Mathematics & Statistics","Type I errors where the null hypothesis is falsely rejected giving afalse positive"
"Mathematics & Statistics","Type II errors where the null hypothesis fails to be rejected and an actual difference between populations is missed giving afalse negative"
"Mathematics & Statistics","Standard deviation refers to the extent to which individual observations in a sample differ from a central value such as the sample or population mean while Standard error refers to an estimate of difference between sample mean and population mean"
"Mathematics & Statistics","A statistical error is the amount by which an observation differs from its expected value a residual is the amount an observation differs from the value the estimator of the expected value assumes on a given sample also called prediction"
"Mathematics & Statistics","Mean squared error is used for obtaining efficient estimators a widely used class of estimators Root mean square error is simply the square root of mean squared error"
"Mathematics & Statistics","A least squares fit in red the points to be fitted in blue the fitted line"
"Mathematics & Statistics","Many statistical methods seek to minimize the residual sum of squares and these are calledmethods of least squaresin contrast to Least absolute deviations The latter gives equal weight to small and big errors while the former gives more weight to large errors Residual sum of squares is also differentiable which provides a handy property for doing regression Least squares applied to linear regression is called ordinary least squares method and least squares applied to nonlinear regression is called non linear least squares Also in a linear regression model the non deterministic part of the model is called error term disturbance or more simply noise Both linear regression and non linear regression are addressed in polynomial least squares which also describes the variance in a prediction of the dependent variable y axis as a function of the independent variable x axis and the deviations errors noise disturbances from the estimated fitted curve"
"Mathematics & Statistics","Measurement processes that generate statistical data are also subject to error Many of these errors are classified as random noise or systematic bias but other types of errors eg blunder such as when an analyst reports incorrect units can also be important The presence of missing data or censoring may result in biased estimates and specific techniques have been developed to address these problems"
"Mathematics & Statistics","Confidence intervals the red line is true value for the mean in this example the blue lines are random confidence intervals for realizations"
"Mathematics & Statistics","Most studies only sample part of a population so results don't fully represent the whole population Any estimates obtained from the sample only approximate the population value Confidence intervals allow statisticians to express how closely the sample estimate matches the true value in the whole population Often they are expressed as % confidence intervals Formally a % confidence interval for a value is a range where if the sampling and analysis were repeated under the same conditions yielding a different dataset the interval would include the true population value in % of all possible cases This does not imply that the probability that the true value is in the confidence interval is % From the frequentist perspective such a claim does not even make sense as the true value is not a random variable Either the true value is or is not within the given interval However it is true that before any data are sampled and given a plan for how to construct the confidence interval the probability is % that the yet to be calculated interval will cover the true value at this point the limits of the interval are yet to be observed random variables One approach that does yield an interval that can be interpreted as having a given probability of containing the true value is to use a credible interval from Bayesian statistics this approach depends on a different way of interpreting what is meant byprobability that is as a Bayesian probability"
"Mathematics & Statistics","In principle confidence intervals can be symmetrical or asymmetrical An interval can be asymmetrical because it works as lower or upper bound for a parameter left sided interval or right sided interval but it can also be asymmetrical because the two sided interval is built violating symmetry around the estimate Sometimes the bounds for a confidence interval are reached asymptotically and these are used to approximate the true bounds"
"Mathematics & Statistics","Statistics rarely give a simple Yes No type answer to the question under analysis Interpretation often comes down to the level of statistical significance applied to the numbers and often refers to the probability of a value accurately rejecting the null hypothesis sometimes referred to as the p value"
"Mathematics & Statistics","In this graph the black line is probability distribution for the test statistic the critical region is the set of values to the right of the observed data point observed value of the test statistic and the p value is represented by the green area"
"Mathematics & Statistics","The standard approach is to test a null hypothesis against an alternative hypothesis A critical region is the set of values of the estimator that leads to refuting the null hypothesis The probability of type I error is therefore the probability that the estimator belongs to the critical region given that null hypothesis is true statistical significance and the probability of type II error is the probability that the estimator doesn't belong to the critical region given that the alternative hypothesis is true The statistical power of a test is the probability that it correctly rejects the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is false"
"Mathematics & Statistics","Referring to statistical significance does not necessarily mean that the overall result is significant in real world terms For example in a large study of a drug it may be shown that the drug has a statistically significant but very small beneficial effect such that the drug is unlikely to help the patient noticeably"
"Mathematics & Statistics","Although in principle the acceptable level of statistical significance may be subject to debate the p value is the smallest significance level that allows the test to reject the null hypothesis This test is logically equivalent to saying that the p value is the probability assuming the null hypothesis is true of observing a result at least as extreme as the test statistic Therefore the smaller the p value the lower the probability of committing type I error"
"Mathematics & Statistics","Some problems are usually associated with this framework See criticism of hypothesis testing"
"Mathematics & Statistics","A difference that is highly statistically significant can still be of no practical significance but it is possible to properly formulate tests to account for this One response involves going beyond reporting only the significance level to include the p value when reporting whether a hypothesis is rejected or accepted The p value however does not indicate the size or importance of the observed effect and can also seem to exaggerate the importance of minor differences in large studies A better and increasingly common approach is to report confidence intervals Although these are produced from the same calculations as those of hypothesis tests or p values they describe both the size of the effect and the uncertainty surrounding it"
"Mathematics & Statistics","Fallacy of the transposed conditional aka prosecutor's fallacy criticisms arise because the hypothesis testing approach forces one hypothesis the null hypothesis to be favored since what is being evaluated is the probability of the observed result given the null hypothesis and not probability of the null hypothesis given the observed result An alternative to this approach is offered by Bayesian inference although it requires establishing a prior probability"
"Mathematics & Statistics","Rejecting the null hypothesis does not automatically prove the alternative hypothesis"
"Mathematics & Statistics","As everything in inferential statistics it relies on sample size and therefore under fat tails p values may be seriously mis computedclarification needed"
"Mathematics & Statistics","Exploratory data analysis EDA is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics often with visual methods A statistical model can be used or not but primarily EDA is for seeing what the data can tell us beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task"
"Mathematics & Statistics","Misuse of statistics can produce subtle but serious errors in description and interpretation subtle in the sense that even experienced professionals make such errors and serious in the sense that they can lead to devastating decision errors For instance social policy medical practice and the reliability of structures like bridges all rely on the proper use of statistics"
"Mathematics & Statistics","Even when statistical techniques are correctly applied the results can be difficult to interpret for those lacking expertise The statistical significance of a trend in the data which measures the extent to which a trend could be caused by random variation in the sample may or may not agree with an intuitive sense of its significance The set of basic statistical skills and skepticism that people need to deal with information in their everyday lives properly is referred to as statistical literacy"
"Mathematics & Statistics","There is a general perception that statistical knowledge is all too frequently intentionally misused by finding ways to interpret only the data that are favorable to the presenter A mistrust and misunderstanding of statistics is associated with the quotation,There are three kinds of lies lies damned lies and statisticsMisuse of statistics can be both inadvertent and intentional and the book How to Lie with Statistics outlines a range of considerations In an attempt to shed light on the use and misuse of statistics reviews of statistical techniques used in particular fields are conducted eg Warne Lazo Ramos and Ritter"
"Mathematics & Statistics","Ways to avoid misuse of statistics include using proper diagrams and avoiding bias Misuse can occur when conclusions are overgeneralized and claimed to be representative of more than they really are often by either deliberately or unconsciously overlooking sampling bias Bar graphs are arguably the easiest diagrams to use and understand and they can be made either by hand or with simple computer programs Unfortunately most people do not look for bias or errors so they are not noticed Thus people may often believe that something is true even if it is not well represented To make data gathered from statistics believable and accurate the sample taken must be representative of the whole According to Huff,The dependability of a sample can be destroyed by bias allow yourself some degree of skepticism"

"Mathematics & Statistics","The confounding variable problem X and Y may be correlated not because there is causal relationship between them but because both depend on a third variable Z Z is called a confounding factor"
"Mathematics & Statistics","The concept of correlation is particularly noteworthy for the potential confusion it can cause Statistical analysis of a data set often reveals that two variables properties of the population under consideration tend to vary together as if they were connected For example a study of annual income that also looks at age of death might find that poor people tend to have shorter lives than affluent people The two variables are said to be correlated however they may or may not be the cause of one another The correlation phenomena could be caused by a third previously unconsidered phenomenon called a lurking variable or confounding variable For this reason there is no way to immediately infer the existence of a causal relationship between the two variables See Correlation does not imply causation"

"Mathematics & Statistics","Probability is a numerical description of how likely an event is to occur or how likely it is that a proposition is true Probability is a number between and where roughly speaking indicates impossibility and indicates certaintynote The higher the probability of an event the more likely it is that the event will occur A simple example is the tossing of a fair unbiased coin Since the coin is fair the two outcomesheadsandtailsare both equally probable the probability ofheadsequals the probability oftails and since no other outcomes are possible the probability of eitherheadsortailsis which could also be written as or %"
"Mathematics & Statistics","These concepts have been given an axiomatic mathematical formalization in probability theory which is used widely in such areas of study as mathematics statistics finance gambling science in particular physics artificial intelligence machine learning computer science game theory and philosophy to for example draw inferences about the expected frequency of events Probability theory is also used to describe the underlying mechanics and regularities of complex systems"
"Mathematics & Statistics","When dealing with experiments that are random and well defined in a purely theoretical setting like tossing a fair coin probabilities can be numerically described by the number of desired outcomes divided by the total number of all outcomes For example tossing a fair coin twice will yieldhead head head tail tail head andtail tailoutcomes The probability of getting an outcome ofhead headis out of outcomes or in numerical terms or % However when it comes to practical application there are two major competing categories of probability interpretations whose adherents possess different views about the fundamental nature of probability"
"Mathematics & Statistics","Objectivists assign numbers to describe some objective or physical state of affairs The most popular version of objective probability is frequentist probability which claims that the probability of a random event denotes the relative frequency of occurrence of an experiment's outcome when repeating the experiment This interpretation considers probability to be the relative frequencyin the long runof outcomes A modification of this is propensity probability which interprets probability as the tendency of some experiment to yield a certain outcome even if it is performed only once"
"Mathematics & Statistics","Subjectivists assign numbers per subjective probability ie as a degree of belief The degree of belief has been interpreted as,the price at which you would buy or sell a bet that pays unit of utility if E if not EThe most popular version of subjective probability is Bayesian probability which includes expert knowledge as well as experimental data to produce probabilities The expert knowledge is represented by some subjective prior probability distribution These data are incorporated in a likelihood function The product of the prior and the likelihood normalized results in a posterior probability distribution that incorporates all the information known to date By Aumann's agreement theorem Bayesian agents whose prior beliefs are similar will end up with similar posterior beliefs However sufficiently different priors can lead to different conclusions regardless of how much information the agents share"
"Mathematics & Statistics","See also History of probability § Etymology and Glossary of probability and statistics"
"Mathematics & Statistics","The word probability derives from the Latin probabilitas which can also meanprobity a measure of the authority of a witness in a legal case in Europe and often correlated with the witness's nobility In a sense this differs much from the modern meaning of probability which in contrast is a measure of the weight of empirical evidence and is arrived at from inductive reasoning and statistical inference"
"Mathematics & Statistics","The scientific study of probability is a modern development of mathematics Gambling shows that there has been an interest in quantifying the ideas of probability for millennia but exact mathematical descriptions arose much later There are reasons for the slow development of the mathematics of probability Whereas games of chance provided the impetus for the mathematical study of probability fundamental issuesclarification needed are still obscured by the superstitions of gamblers"
"Mathematics & Statistics","According to Richard Jeffrey,Before the middle of the seventeenth century the term 'probable' Latin probabilis meant approvable and was applied in that sense univocally to opinion and to action A probable action or opinion was one such as sensible people would undertake or hold in the circumstancesHowever in legal contexts especially 'probable' could also apply to propositions for which there was good evidence"
"Mathematics & Statistics","Al Kindi's Book of Cryptographic Messages contains the earliest known use of statistical inference th century"
"Mathematics & Statistics","The earliest known forms of probability and statistics were developed by Middle Eastern mathematicians studying cryptography between the th and th centuries Al Khalil wrote the Book of Cryptographic Messages which contains the first use of permutations and combinations to list all possible Arabic words with and without vowels Al Kindi made the earliest known use of statistical inference in his work on cryptanalysis and frequency analysis An important contribution of Ibn Adlan was on sample size for use of frequency analysis"
"Mathematics & Statistics","Christiaan Huygens published one of the first books on probability th century"
"Mathematics & Statistics","The sixteenth century Italian polymath Gerolamo Cardano demonstrated the efficacy of defining odds as the ratio of favourable to unfavourable outcomes which implies that the probability of an event is given by the ratio of favourable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes Aside from the elementary work by Cardano the doctrine of probabilities dates to the correspondence of Pierre de Fermat and Blaise Pascal Christiaan Huygens gave the earliest known scientific treatment of the subject Jakob Bernoulli's Ars Conjectandi posthumous and Abraham de Moivre's Doctrine of Chances treated the subject as a branch of mathematics See Ian Hacking's The Emergence of Probability and James Franklin's The Science of Conjecture for histories of the early development of the very concept of mathematical probability"
"Mathematics & Statistics","The theory of errors may be traced back to Roger Cotes's Opera Miscellanea posthumous but a memoir prepared by Thomas Simpson in printed first applied the theory to the discussion of errors of observation The reprint of this memoir lays down the axioms that positive and negative errors are equally probable and that certain assignable limits define the range of all errors Simpson also discusses continuous errors and describes a probability curve"
"Mathematics & Statistics","The first two laws of error that were proposed both originated with Pierre Simon Laplace The first law was published in and stated that the frequency of an error could be expressed as an exponential function of the numerical magnitude of the error disregarding sign The second law of error was proposed in by Laplace and stated that the frequency of the error is an exponential function of the square of the error The second law of error is called the normal distribution or the Gauss lawIt is difficult historically to attribute that law to Gauss who in spite of his well known precocity had probably not made this discovery before he was two years old"
"Mathematics & Statistics","Daniel Bernoulli introduced the principle of the maximum product of the probabilities of a system of concurrent errors"
"Mathematics & Statistics","Adrien Marie Legendre developed the method of least squares and introduced it in his Nouvelles méthodes pour la détermination des orbites des comètes New Methods for Determining the Orbits of Comets In ignorance of Legendre's contribution an Irish American writer Robert Adrain editor ofThe Analyst first deduced the law of facility of error"

"Mathematics & Statistics","In the nineteenth century authors on the general theory included Laplace Sylvestre Lacroix Littrow Adolphe Quetelet Richard Dedekind Helmert Hermann Laurent Liagre Didion and Karl Pearson Augustus De Morgan and George Boole improved the exposition of the theory"
"Mathematics & Statistics","Andrey Markov introduced the notion of Markov chains which played an important role in stochastic processes theory and its applications The modern theory of probability based on the measure theory was developed by Andrey Kolmogorov"
"Mathematics & Statistics","On the geometric side see integral geometry contributors to The Educational Times were influential Miller Crofton McColl Wolstenholme Watson and Artemas Martin"
"Mathematics & Statistics","Like other theories the theory of probability is a representation of its concepts in formal terms that is in terms that can be considered separately from their meaning These formal terms are manipulated by the rules of mathematics and logic and any results are interpreted or translated back into the problem domain"
"Mathematics & Statistics","There have been at least two successful attempts to formalize probability namely the Kolmogorov formulation and the Cox formulation In Kolmogorov's formulation see probability space sets are interpreted as events and probability itself as a measure on a class of sets In Cox's theorem probability is taken as a primitive that is not further analyzed and the emphasis is on constructing a consistent assignment of probability values to propositions In both cases the laws of probability are the same except for technical details"
"Mathematics & Statistics","There are other methods for quantifying uncertainty such as the Dempster–Shafer theory or possibility theory but those are essentially different and not compatible with the laws of probability as usually understood"
"Mathematics & Statistics","Probability theory is applied in everyday life in risk assessment and modeling The insurance industry and markets use actuarial science to determine pricing and make trading decisions Governments apply probabilistic methods in environmental regulation entitlement analysis Reliability theory of aging and longevity and financial regulation"
"Mathematics & Statistics","A good example of the use of probability theory in equity trading is the effect of the perceived probability of any widespread Middle East conflict on oil prices which have ripple effects in the economy as a whole An assessment by a commodity trader that a war is more likely can send that commodity's prices up or down and signals other traders of that opinion Accordingly the probabilities are neither assessed independently nor necessarily very rationally The theory of behavioral finance emerged to describe the effect of such groupthink on pricing on policy and on peace and conflict"
"Mathematics & Statistics","In addition to financial assessment probability can be used to analyze trends in biology eg disease spread as well as ecology eg biological Punnett squares As with finance risk assessment can be used as a statistical tool to calculate the likelihood of undesirable events occurring and can assist with implementing protocols to avoid encountering such circumstances Probability is used to design games of chance so that casinos can make a guaranteed profit yet provide payouts to players that are frequent enough to encourage continued play"
"Mathematics & Statistics","The discovery of rigorous methods to assess and combine probability assessments has changed societycitation needed"

"Mathematics & Statistics","The cache language model and other statistical language models that are used in natural language processing are also examples of applications of probability theory"
"Mathematics & Statistics","Consider an experiment that can produce a number of results The collection of all possible results is called the sample space of the experiment The power set of the sample space is formed by considering all different collections of possible results For example rolling a die can produce six possible results One collection of possible results gives an odd number on the die Thus the subset {,,} is an element of the power set of the sample space of dice rolls These collections are calledeventsIn this case {,,} is the event that the die falls on some odd number If the results that actually occur fall in a given event the event is said to have occurred"
"Mathematics & Statistics","A probability is a way of assigning every event a value between zero and one with the requirement that the event made up of all possible results in our example the event {,,,,,} is assigned a value of one To qualify as a probability the assignment of values must satisfy the requirement that if you look at a collection of mutually exclusive events events with no common results eg the events {,} {} and {,} are all mutually exclusive the probability that at least one of the events will occur is given by the sum of the probabilities of all the individual events"
"Mathematics & Statistics","This mathematical definition of probability can extend to infinite sample spaces and even uncountable sample spaces using the concept of a measure"
"Mathematics & Statistics","The opposite or complement of an event A is the event not A that is the event of A not occurring often denoted as"
"Mathematics & Statistics"," its probability is given by Pnot A = − PA As an example the chance of not rolling a six on a six sided die is chance of rolling a six"
"Mathematics & Statistics","If two events A and B occur on a single performance of an experiment this is called the intersection or joint probability of A and B denoted as"
"Mathematics & Statistics","If two events A and B are independent then the joint probability is"
"Mathematics & Statistics","for example if two coins are flipped the chance of both being heads is"
"Mathematics & Statistics","If either event A or event B but never both occurs on a single performance of an experiment then they are called mutually exclusive events"
"Mathematics & Statistics","If two events are mutually exclusive then the probability of both occurring is denoted as"

"Mathematics & Statistics","For example in a bag of red balls and blue balls balls in total the probability of taking a red ball is"

"Mathematics & Statistics","Relation to randomness and probability in quantum mechanicsedit"
"Mathematics & Statistics","In a deterministic universe based on Newtonian concepts there would be no probability if all conditions were known Laplace's demon but there are situations in which sensitivity to initial conditions exceeds our ability to measure them ie know them In the case of a roulette wheel if the force of the hand and the period of that force are known the number on which the ball will stop would be a certainty though as a practical matter this would likely be true only of a roulette wheel that had not been exactly levelled as Thomas A Bass' Newtonian Casino revealed This also assumes knowledge of inertia and friction of the wheel weight smoothness and roundness of the ball variations in hand speed during the turning and so forth A probabilistic description can thus be more useful than Newtonian mechanics for analyzing the pattern of outcomes of repeated rolls of a roulette wheel Physicists face the same situation in kinetic theory of gases where the system while deterministic in principle is so complex with the number of molecules typically the order of magnitude of the Avogadro constant × that only a statistical description of its properties is feasible"
"Mathematics & Statistics","Probability theory is required to describe quantum phenomena A revolutionary discovery of early th century physics was the random character of all physical processes that occur at sub atomic scales and are governed by the laws of quantum mechanics The objective wave function evolves deterministically but according to the Copenhagen interpretation it deals with probabilities of observing the outcome being explained by a wave function collapse when an observation is made However the loss of determinism for the sake of instrumentalism did not meet with universal approval Albert Einstein famously remarked in a letter to Max Born I am convinced that God does not play diceLike Einstein Erwin Schrödinger who discovered the wave function believed quantum mechanics is a statistical approximation of an underlying deterministic reality In some modern interpretations of the statistical mechanics of measurement quantum decoherence is invoked to account for the appearance of subjectively probabilistic experimental outcomes"
"Mathematics & Statistics","Strictly speaking a probability of indicates that an event almost never takes place whereas a probability of indicates than an event almost certainly takes place This is an important distinction when the sample space is infinite For example for the continuous uniform distribution on the real interval there are an infinite number of possible outcomes and the probability of any given outcome being observed   for instance exactly   is This means that when we make an observation it will almost surely not be exactly However it does not mean that exactly is impossible Ultimately some specific outcome with probability will be observed and one possibility for that specific outcome is exactly"

"Public Health & Health Services","The history of public health care clearly shows the global effort to improve health care for allcitation needed However in modern day medicine real measurable change has not been clearly seen and critics argue that this lack of improvement is due to ineffective methods that are being implemented As argued by Paul E Farmer structural interventions could possibly have a large impact and yet there are numerous problems as to why this strategy has yet to be incorporated into the health system One of the main reasons that he suggests could be the fact that physicians are not properly trained to carry out structural interventions meaning that the ground level health care professionals cannot implement these improvements While structural interventions can not be the only area for improvement the lack of coordination between socioeconomic factors and health care for the poor could be counterproductive and end up causing greater inequity between the health care services received by the rich and by the poor Unless health care is no longer treated as a commodity global public health will ultimately not be achievedcitation needed This being the case without changing the way in which health care is delivered to those who have less access to it the universal goal of public health care cannot be achieved"

"Physics & Astronomy","Reflections can be divided into two types specular reflection and diffuse reflection Specular reflection describes the gloss of surfaces such as mirrors which reflect light in a simple predictable way This allows for production of reflected images that can be associated with an actual real or extrapolated virtual location in space Diffuse reflection describes non glossy materials such as paper or rock The reflections from these surfaces can only be described statistically with the exact distribution of the reflected light depending on the microscopic structure of the material Many diffuse reflectors are described or can be approximated by Lambert's cosine law which describes surfaces that have equal luminance when viewed from any angle Glossy surfaces can give both specular and diffuse reflection"

"General Science & Technology","Natural science is concerned with the description prediction and understanding of natural phenomena based on empirical evidence from observation and experimentation It can be divided into two main branches life science or biological science and physical science Physical science is subdivided into branches including physics chemistry astronomy and earth science These two branches may be further divided into more specialized disciplines Modern natural science is the successor to the natural philosophy that began in Ancient Greece Galileo Descartes Bacon and Newton debated the benefits of using approaches which were more mathematical and more experimental in a methodical way Still philosophical perspectives conjectures and presuppositions often overlooked remain necessary in natural science Systematic data collection including discovery science succeeded natural history which emerged in the th century by describing and classifying plants animals minerals and so on Today,natural historysuggests observational descriptions aimed at popular audiences"
"General Science & Technology","In economics the supply and demand model describes how prices vary as a result of a balance between product availability and demand"
"General Science & Technology","Social science is concerned with society and the relationships among individuals within a society It has many branches that include but are not limited to anthropology archaeology communication studies economics history human geography jurisprudence linguistics political science psychology public health and sociology Social scientists may adopt various philosophical theories to study individuals and society For example positivist social scientists use methods resembling those of the natural sciences as tools for understanding society and so define science in its stricter modern sense Interpretivist social scientists by contrast may use social critique or symbolic interpretation rather than constructing empirically falsifiable theories and thus treat science in its broader sense In modern academic practice researchers are often eclectic using multiple methodologies for instance by combining both quantitative and qualitative research The termsocial researchhas also acquired a degree of autonomy as practitioners from various disciplines share in its aims and methods"
"General Science & Technology","Formal science is involved in the study of formal systems It includes mathematics systems theory and theoretical computer science The formal sciences share similarities with the other two branches by relying on objective careful and systematic study of an area of knowledge They are however different from the empirical sciences as they rely exclusively on deductive reasoning without the need for empirical evidence to verify their abstract concepts The formal sciences are therefore a priori disciplines and because of this there is disagreement on whether they actually constitute a science Nevertheless the formal sciences play an important role in the empirical sciences Calculus for example was initially invented to understand motion in physics Natural and social sciences that rely heavily on mathematical applications include mathematical physics mathematical chemistry mathematical biology mathematical finance and mathematical economics"
"General Science & Technology","Scientific research can be labeled as either basic or applied research Basic research is the search for knowledge and applied research is the search for solutions to practical problems using this knowledge Although some scientific research is applied research into specific problems a great deal of our understanding comes from the curiosity driven undertaking of basic research This leads to options for technological advance that were not planned or sometimes even imaginable This point was made by Michael Faraday when allegedly in response to the questionwhat is the use of basic research he responded Sir what is the use of a new born child For example research into the effects of red light on the human eye's rod cells did not seem to have any practical purpose eventually the discovery that our night vision is not troubled by red light would lead search and rescue teams among others to adopt red light in the cockpits of jets and helicopters Finally even basic research can take unexpected turns and there is some sense in which the scientific method is built to harness luck"
"General Science & Technology","The central star IRAS was captured by the Advanced Camera for Surveys aboard the Hubble Space Telescope"
"General Science & Technology","Scientific research involves using the scientific method which seeks to objectively explain the events of nature in a reproducible way An explanatory thought experiment or hypothesis is put forward as explanation using principles such as parsimony also known asOccam's Razorand are generally expected to seek consilience fitting well with other accepted facts related to the phenomena This new explanation is used to make falsifiable predictions that are testable by experiment or observation The predictions are to be posted before a confirming experiment or observation is sought as proof that no tampering has occurred Disproof of a prediction is evidence of progressef This is done partly through observation of natural phenomena but also through experimentation that tries to simulate natural events under controlled conditions as appropriate to the discipline in the observational sciences such as astronomy or geology a predicted observation might take the place of a controlled experiment Experimentation is especially important in science to help establish causal relationships to avoid the correlation fallacy"
"General Science & Technology","When a hypothesis proves unsatisfactory it is either modified or discarded If the hypothesis survived testing it may become adopted into the framework of a scientific theory a logically reasoned self consistent model or framework for describing the behavior of certain natural phenomena A theory typically describes the behavior of much broader sets of phenomena than a hypothesis commonly a large number of hypotheses can be logically bound together by a single theory Thus a theory is a hypothesis explaining various other hypotheses In that vein theories are formulated according to most of the same scientific principles as hypotheses In addition to testing hypotheses scientists may also generate a model an attempt to describe or depict the phenomenon in terms of a logical physical or mathematical representation and to generate new hypotheses that can be tested based on observable phenomena"
"General Science & Technology","While performing experiments to test hypotheses scientists may have a preference for one outcome over another and so it is important to ensure that science as a whole can eliminate this bias This can be achieved by careful experimental design transparency and a thorough peer review process of the experimental results as well as any conclusions After the results of an experiment are announced or published it is normal practice for independent researchers to double check how the research was performed and to follow up by performing similar experiments to determine how dependable the results might be Taken in its entirety the scientific method allows for highly creative problem solving while minimizing any effects of subjective bias on the part of its users especially the confirmation bias"
"General Science & Technology","John Ziman points out that intersubjective verifiability is fundamental to the creation of all scientific knowledge Ziman shows how scientists can identify patterns to each other across centuries he refers to this ability asperceptual consensibilityHe then makes consensibility leading to consensus the touchstone of reliable knowledge"
"General Science & Technology","Calculus the mathematics of continuous change underpins many of the sciences"
"General Science & Technology","Mathematics is essential in the formation of hypotheses theories and laws in the natural and social sciences For example it is used in quantitative scientific modeling which can generate new hypotheses and predictions to be tested It is also used extensively in observing and collecting measurements Statistics a branch of mathematics is used to summarize and analyze data which allow scientists to assess the reliability and variability of their experimental results"

"General Science & Technology","English philosopher and physician John Locke a leading philosopher of British empiricism"
"General Science & Technology","Scientists usually take for granted a set of basic assumptions that are needed to justify the scientific method that there is an objective reality shared by all rational observers that this objective reality is governed by natural laws that these laws can be discovered by means of systematic observation and experimentation Philosophy of science seeks a deep understanding of what these underlying assumptions mean and whether they are valid"
"General Science & Technology","The belief that scientific theories should and do represent metaphysical reality is known as realism It can be contrasted with anti realism the view that the success of science does not depend on it being accurate about unobservable entities such as electrons One form of anti realism is idealism the belief that the mind or consciousness is the most basic essence and that each mind generates its own realityg In an idealistic world view what is true for one mind need not be true for other minds"
"General Science & Technology","There are different schools of thought in philosophy of science The most popular position is empiricism,h which holds that knowledge is created by a process involving observation and that scientific theories are the result of generalizations from such observations Empiricism generally encompasses inductivism a position that tries to explain the way general theories can be justified by the finite number of observations humans can make and hence the finite amount of empirical evidence available to confirm scientific theories This is necessary because the number of predictions those theories make is infinite which means that they cannot be known from the finite amount of evidence using deductive logic only Many versions of empiricism exist with the predominant ones being Bayesianism and the hypothetico deductive method"
"General Science & Technology","The Austrian British philosopher of science Karl Popper in He is best known for his work on empirical falsification"
"General Science & Technology","Empiricism has stood in contrast to rationalism the position originally associated with Descartes which holds that knowledge is created by the human intellect not by observation Critical rationalism is a contrasting th century approach to science first defined by Austrian British philosopher Karl Popper Popper rejected the way that empiricism describes the connection between theory and observation He claimed that theories are not generated by observation but that observation is made in the light of theories and that the only way a theory can be affected by observation is when it comes in conflict with it Popper proposed replacing verifiability with falsifiability as the landmark of scientific theories and replacing induction with falsification as the empirical method Popper further claimed that there is actually only one universal method not specific to science the negative method of criticism trial and error It covers all products of the human mind including science mathematics philosophy and art"
"General Science & Technology","Another approach instrumentalism colloquially termedshut up and multiply"
"General Science & Technology","Thomas Kuhn argued that the process of observation and evaluation takes place within a paradigm a logically consistentportraitof the world that is consistent with observations made from its framing He characterized normal science as the process of observation andpuzzle solvingwhich takes place within a paradigm whereas revolutionary science occurs when one paradigm overtakes another in a paradigm shift Each paradigm has its own distinct questions aims and interpretations The choice between paradigms involves setting two or moreportraitsagainst the world and deciding which likeness is most promising A paradigm shift occurs when a significant number of observational anomalies arise in the old paradigm and a new paradigm makes sense of them That is the choice of a new paradigm is based on observations even though those observations are made against the background of the old paradigm For Kuhn acceptance or rejection of a paradigm is a social process as much as a logical process Kuhn's position however is not one of relativism"
"General Science & Technology","Finally another approach often cited in debates of scientific skepticism against controversial movements likecreation scienceis methodological naturalism Its main point is that a difference between natural and supernatural explanations should be made and that science should be restricted methodologically to natural explanationsi That the restriction is merely methodological rather than ontological means that science should not consider supernatural explanations itself but should not claim them to be wrong either Instead supernatural explanations should be left a matter of personal belief outside the scope of science Methodological naturalism maintains that proper science requires strict adherence to empirical study and independent verification as a process for properly developing and evaluating explanations for observable phenomena The absence of these standards arguments from authority biased observational studies and other common fallacies are frequently cited by supporters of methodological naturalism as characteristic of the non science they criticize"
"General Science & Technology","A scientific theory is empiricalh and is always open to falsification if new evidence is presented That is no theory is ever considered strictly certain as science accepts the concept of fallibilismj The philosopher of science Karl Popper sharply distinguished truth from certainty He wrote that scientific knowledgeconsists in the search for truth"
"General Science & Technology","New scientific knowledge rarely results in vast changes in our understanding According to psychologist Keith Stanovich it may be the media's overuse of words likebreakthroughthat leads the public to imagine that science is constantly proving everything it thought was true to be false While there are such famous cases as the theory of relativity that required a complete reconceptualization these are extreme exceptions Knowledge in science is gained by a gradual synthesis of information from different experiments by various researchers across different branches of science it is more like a climb than a leap Theories vary in the extent to which they have been tested and verified as well as their acceptance in the scientific communityk For example heliocentric theory the theory of evolution relativity theory and germ theory still bear the nametheoryeven though in practice they are considered factual Philosopher Barry Stroud adds that although the best definition forknowledgeis contested being skeptical and entertaining the possibility that one is incorrect is compatible with being correct Therefore scientists adhering to proper scientific approaches will doubt themselves even once they possess the truth The fallibilist C S Peirce argued that inquiry is the struggle to resolve actual doubt and that merely quarrelsome verbal or hyperbolic doubt is fruitless but also that the inquirer should try to attain genuine doubt rather than resting uncritically on common sense He held that the successful sciences trust not to any single chain of inference no stronger than its weakest link but to the cable of multiple and various arguments intimately connected"
"General Science & Technology","Stanovich also asserts that science avoids searching for amagic bullet it avoids the single cause fallacy This means a scientist would not ask merelyWhat is the cause of but ratherWhat are the most significant causes of This is especially the case in the more macroscopic fields of science eg psychology physical cosmology Research often analyzes few factors at once but these are always added to the long list of factors that are most important to consider For example knowing the details of only a person's genetics or their history and upbringing or the current situation may not explain a behavior but a deep understanding of all these variables combined can be very predictive"

"General Science & Technology","Scientists exhibit a strong curiosity about reality with some scientists having a desire to apply scientific knowledge for the benefit of health nations environment or industries Other motivations include recognition by their peers and prestige The Nobel Prize a widely regarded prestigious award is awarded annually to those who have achieved scientific advances in the fields of medicine physics chemistry and economics"
"General Science & Technology","Marie Curie was the first person to be awarded two Nobel Prizes Physics in and Chemistry in"
"General Science & Technology","Science has historically been a male dominated field with some notable exceptionsn Women faced considerable discrimination in science much as they did in other areas of male dominated societies such as frequently being passed over for job opportunities and denied credit for their worko For example Christine Ladd was able to enter a PhD program asC Ladd ChristineKittyLadd completed the requirements in but was awarded her degree only in after a career which spanned the algebra of logic see truth table color vision and psychology Her work preceded notable researchers like Ludwig Wittgenstein and Charles Sanders Peirce The achievements of women in science have been attributed to their defiance of their traditional role as laborers within the domestic sphere"
"General Science & Technology","In the late th century active recruitment of women and elimination of institutional discrimination on the basis of sex greatly increased the number of women scientists but large gender disparities remain in some fields in the early st century over half of new biologists were female while % of PhDs in physics are given to mencitation needed In the early part of the st century women in the United States earned % of bachelor's degrees % of master's degrees and % of PhDs in science and engineering fields They earned more than half of the degrees in psychology about % social sciences about % and biology about % but earned less than half the degrees in the physical sciences earth sciences mathematics engineering and computer science Lifestyle choice also plays a major role in female engagement in science women with young children are % less likely to take tenure track positions due to work life balance issues and female graduate students' interest in careers in research declines dramatically over the course of graduate school whereas that of their male colleagues remains unchanged"
"General Science & Technology","Learned societies for the communication and promotion of scientific thought and experimentation have existed since the Renaissance Many scientists belong to a learned society that promotes their respective scientific discipline profession or group of related disciplines Membership may be open to all may require possession of some scientific credentials or may be an honor conferred by election Most scientific societies are non profit organizations and many are professional associations Their activities typically include holding regular conferences for the presentation and discussion of new research results and publishing or sponsoring academic journals in their discipline Some also act as professional bodies regulating the activities of their members in the public interest or the collective interest of the membership Scholars in the sociology of sciencewho  argue that learned societies are of key importance and their formation assists in the emergence and development of new disciplines or professions"
"General Science & Technology","The professionalization of science begun in the th century was partly enabled by the creation of distinguished academy of sciences in a number of countries such as the Italian Accademia dei Lincei in the British Royal Society in the French Académie des Sciences in the American National Academy of Sciences in the German Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in and the Chinese Academy of Sciences in International scientific organizations such as the International Council for Science have since been formed to promote cooperation between the scientific communities of different nations"

"General Science & Technology","Science policy is an area of public policy concerned with the policies that affect the conduct of the scientific enterprise including research funding often in pursuance of other national policy goals such as technological innovation to promote commercial product development weapons development health care and environmental monitoring Science policy also refers to the act of applying scientific knowledge and consensus to the development of public policies Science policy thus deals with the entire domain of issues that involve the natural sciences In accordance with public policy being concerned about the well being of its citizens science policy's goal is to consider how science and technology can best serve the public"
"General Science & Technology","State policy has influenced the funding of public works and science for thousands of years particularly within civilizations with highly organized governments such as imperial China and the Roman Empire Prominent historical examples include the Great Wall of China completed over the course of two millennia through the state support of several dynasties and the Grand Canal of the Yangtze River an immense feat of hydraulic engineering begun by Sunshu Ao 孫叔敖 th c BCE Ximen Bao 西門豹 th cBCE and Shi Chi th c BCE This construction dates from the th century BCE under the Sui Dynasty and is still in use today In China such state supported infrastructure and scientific research projects date at least from the time of the Mohists who inspired the study of logic during the period of the Hundred Schools of Thought and the study of defensive fortifications like the Great Wall of China during the Warring States period"
"General Science & Technology","Public policy can directly affect the funding of capital equipment and intellectual infrastructure for industrial research by providing tax incentives to those organizations that fund research Vannevar Bush director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development for the United States government the forerunner of the National Science Foundation wrote in July thatScience is a proper concern of government"
"General Science & Technology","The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation CSIRO Main Entomology Building in Australia"
"General Science & Technology","Scientific research is often funded through a competitive process in which potential research projects are evaluated and only the most promising receive funding Such processes which are run by government corporations or foundations allocate scarce funds Total research funding in most developed countries is between % and % of GDP In the OECD around two thirds of research and development in scientific and technical fields is carried out by industry and % and % respectively by universities and government The government funding proportion in certain industries is higher and it dominates research in social science and humanities Similarly with some exceptions eg biotechnology government provides the bulk of the funds for basic scientific research Many governments have dedicated agencies to support scientific research Prominent scientific organizations include the National Science Foundation in the United States the National Scientific and Technical Research Council in Argentina Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation CSIRO in Australia Centre national de la recherche scientifique in France the Max Planck Society and Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft in Germany and CSIC in Spain In commercial research and development all but the most research oriented corporations focus more heavily on near term commercialisation possibilities rather thanblue skyideas or technologies such as nuclear fusion"

"General Science & Technology","The public awareness of science relates to the attitudes behaviors opinions and activities that make up the relations between science and the general public it integrates various themes and activities such as science communication science museums science festivals science fairs citizen science and science in popular culture Social scientists have devised various metrics to measure the public understanding of science such as factual knowledge self reported knowledge and structural knowledge"
"General Science & Technology","The mass media face a number of pressures that can prevent them from accurately depicting competing scientific claims in terms of their credibility within the scientific community as a whole Determining how much weight to give different sides in a scientific debate may require considerable expertise regarding the matter Few journalists have real scientific knowledge and even beat reporters who know a great deal about certain scientific issues may be ignorant about other scientific issues that they are suddenly asked to cover"
"General Science & Technology","Results of seven papers from assessing the overwhelming scientific consensus on man made global warming see Surveys of scientists' views on climate change in contrast to the political controversy over this issue particularly in the United States"
"General Science & Technology","Politicization of science occurs when government business or advocacy groups use legal or economic pressure to influence the findings of scientific research or the way it is disseminated reported or interpreted Many factors can act as facets of the politicization of science such as populist anti intellectualism perceived threats to religious beliefs postmodernist subjectivism and fear for business interests Politicization of science is usually accomplished when scientific information is presented in a way that emphasizes the uncertainty associated with the scientific evidence Tactics such as shifting conversation failing to acknowledge facts and capitalizing on doubt of scientific consensus have been used to gain more attention for views that have been undermined by scientific evidence Examples of issues that have involved the politicization of science include the global warming controversy health effects of pesticides and health effects of tobacco"

"General Science & Technology","The simplest form of technology is the development and use of basic tools The prehistoric discovery of how to control fire and the later Neolithic Revolution increased the available sources of food and the invention of the wheel helped humans to travel in and control their environment Developments in historic times including the printing press the telephone and the Internet have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale"
"General Science & Technology","Technology has many effects It has helped develop more advanced economies including today's global economy and has allowed the rise of a leisure class Many technological processes produce unwanted by products known as pollution and deplete natural resources to the detriment of Earth's environment Innovations have always influenced the values of a society and raised new questions in the ethics of technology Examples include the rise of the notion of efficiency in terms of human productivity and the challenges of bioethics"
"General Science & Technology","Philosophical debates have arisen over the use of technology with disagreements over whether technology improves the human condition or worsens it Neo Luddism anarcho primitivism and similar reactionary movements criticize the pervasiveness of technology arguing that it harms the environment and alienates people proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and techno progressivism view continued technological progress as beneficial to society and the human condition"
"General Science & Technology","The spread of paper and printing to the West as in this printing press helped scientists and politicians communicate their ideas easily leading to the Age of Enlightenment an example of technology as cultural force"
"General Science & Technology","The use of the termtechnologyhas changed significantly over the last years Before the th century the term was uncommon in English and it was used either to refer to the description or study of the useful arts or to allude to technical education as in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology chartered in"
"General Science & Technology","The termtechnologyrose to prominence in the th century in connection with the Second Industrial Revolution The term's meanings changed in the early th century when American social scientists beginning with Thorstein Veblen translated ideas from the German concept of Technik intotechnologyIn German and other European languages a distinction exists between technik and technologie that is absent in English which usually translates both terms astechnologyBy the s,technologyreferred not only to the study of the industrial arts but to the industrial arts themselves"
"General Science & Technology","In the American sociologist Read Bain wrote thattechnology includes all tools machines utensils weapons instruments housing clothing communicating and transporting devices and the skills by which we produce and use themBain's definition remains common among scholars today especially social scientists Scientists and engineers usually prefer to define technology as applied science rather than as the things that people make and use More recently scholars have borrowed from European philosophers oftechniqueto extend the meaning of technology to various forms of instrumental reason as in Foucault's work on technologies of the self techniques de soi"
"General Science & Technology","Dictionaries and scholars have offered a variety of definitions The Merriam Webster Learner's Dictionary offers a definition of the term the use of science in industry engineering etc to invent useful things or to solve problemsanda machine piece of equipment method etc that is created by technologyUrsula Franklin in her Real World of Technologylecture gave another definition of the concept it ispractice the way we do things around hereThe term is often used to imply a specific field of technology or to refer to high technology or just consumer electronics rather than technology as a whole Bernard Stiegler in Technics and Time defines technology in two ways asthe pursuit of life by means other than life"
"General Science & Technology","Technology can be most broadly defined as the entities both material and immaterial created by the application of mental and physical effort in order to achieve some value In this usage technology refers to tools and machines that may be used to solve real world problems It is a far reaching term that may include simple tools such as a crowbar or wooden spoon or more complex machines such as a space station or particle accelerator Tools and machines need not be material virtual technology such as computer software and business methods fall under this definition of technology W Brian Arthur defines technology in a similarly broad way asa means to fulfill a human purpose"
"General Science & Technology","The wordtechnologycan also be used to refer to a collection of techniques In this context it is the current state of humanity's knowledge of how to combine resources to produce desired products to solve problems fulfill needs or satisfy wants it includes technical methods skills processes techniques tools and raw materials When combined with another term such asmedical technologyorspace technology"
"General Science & Technology","The invention of integrated circuits and the microprocessor here an Intel chip from led to the modern computer revolution"
"General Science & Technology","Technology can be viewed as an activity that forms or changes culture Additionally technology is the application of math science and the arts for the benefit of life as it is known A modern example is the rise of communication technology which has lessened barriers to human interaction and as a result has helped spawn new subcultures the rise of cyberculture has at its basis the development of the Internet and the computer Not all technology enhances culture in a creative way technology can also help facilitate political oppression and war via tools such as guns As a cultural activity technology predates both science and engineering each of which formalize some aspects of technological endeavor"
"General Science & Technology","Antoine Lavoisier experimenting with combustion generated by amplified sun light"
"General Science & Technology","The distinction between science engineering and technology is not always clear Science is systematic knowledge of the physical or material world gained through observation and experimentation Technologies are not usually exclusively products of science because they have to satisfy requirements such as utility usability and safetycitation needed"
"General Science & Technology","Engineering is the goal oriented process of designing and making tools and systems to exploit natural phenomena for practical human means often but not always using results and techniques from science The development of technology may draw upon many fields of knowledge including scientific engineering mathematical linguistic and historical knowledge to achieve some practical result"
"General Science & Technology","Technology is often a consequence of science and engineering although technology as a human activity precedes the two fields For example science might study the flow of electrons in electrical conductors by using already existing tools and knowledge This new found knowledge may then be used by engineers to create new tools and machines such as semiconductors computers and other forms of advanced technology In this sense scientists and engineers may both be considered technologists the three fields are often considered as one for the purposes of research and reference"
"General Science & Technology","The exact relations between science and technology in particular have been debated by scientists historians and policymakers in the late th century in part because the debate can inform the funding of basic and applied science In the immediate wake of World War II for example it was widely considered in the United States that technology was simplyapplied scienceand that to fund basic science was to reap technological results in due time An articulation of this philosophy could be found explicitly in Vannevar Bush's treatise on postwar science policy Science The Endless Frontier New products new industries and more jobs require continuous additions to knowledge of the laws of nature This essential new knowledge can be obtained only through basic scientific researchIn the late s however this view came under direct attack leading towards initiatives to fund science for specific tasks initiatives resisted by the scientific community The issue remains contentious though most analysts resist the model that technology is a result of scientific research"

"General Science & Technology","The use of tools by early humans was partly a process of discovery and of evolution Early humans evolved from a species of foraging hominids which were already bipedal with a brain mass approximately one third of modern humans Tool use remained relatively unchanged for most of early human history Approximately years ago the use of tools and complex set of behaviors emerged believed by many archaeologists to be connected to the emergence of fully modern language"
"General Science & Technology","Hominids started using primitive stone tools millions of years ago The earliest stone tools were little more than a fractured rock but approximately years ago pressure flaking provided a way to make much finer work"
"General Science & Technology","The discovery and use of fire a simple energy source with many profound uses was a turning point in the technological evolution of humankind The exact date of its discovery is not known evidence of burnt animal bones at the Cradle of Humankind suggests that the domestication of fire occurred before Ma scholarly consensus indicates that Homo erectus had controlled fire by between and ka Fire fueled with wood and charcoal allowed early humans to cook their food to increase its digestibility improving its nutrient value and broadening the number of foods that could be eaten"
"General Science & Technology","Other technological advances made during the Paleolithic era were clothing and shelter the adoption of both technologies cannot be dated exactly but they were a key to humanity's progress As the Paleolithic era progressed dwellings became more sophisticated and more elaborate as early as ka humans were constructing temporary wood huts Clothing adapted from the fur and hides of hunted animals helped humanity expand into colder regions humans began to migrate out of Africa by ka and into other continents such as Eurasia"
"General Science & Technology","An array of Neolithic artifacts including bracelets axe heads chisels and polishing tools"
"General Science & Technology","Human's technological ascent began in earnest in what is known as the Neolithic PeriodNew Stone AgeThe invention of polished stone axes was a major advance that allowed forest clearance on a large scale to create farms This use of polished stone axes increased greatly in the Neolithic but were originally used in the preceding Mesolithic in some areas such as Ireland Agriculture fed larger populations and the transition to sedentism allowed simultaneously raising more children as infants no longer needed to be carried as nomadic ones must Additionally children could contribute labor to the raising of crops more readily than they could to the hunter gatherer economy"
"General Science & Technology","With this increase in population and availability of labor came an increase in labor specialization What triggered the progression from early Neolithic villages to the first cities such as Uruk and the first civilizations such as Sumer is not specifically known however the emergence of increasingly hierarchical social structures and specialized labor of trade and war amongst adjacent cultures and the need for collective action to overcome environmental challenges such as irrigation are all thought to have played a role"
"General Science & Technology","Continuing improvements led to the furnace and bellows and provided for the first time the ability to smelt and forge gold copper silver and lead native metals found in relatively pure form in nature The advantages of copper tools over stone bone and wooden tools were quickly apparent to early humans and native copper was probably used from near the beginning of Neolithic times about ka Native copper does not naturally occur in large amounts but copper ores are quite common and some of them produce metal easily when burned in wood or charcoal fires Eventually the working of metals led to the discovery of alloys such as bronze and brass about BCE The first uses of iron alloys such as steel dates to around BCE"
"General Science & Technology","Meanwhile humans were learning to harness other forms of energy The earliest known use of wind power is the sailing ship the earliest record of a ship under sail is that of a Nile boat dating to the th millennium BCE From prehistoric times Egyptians probably used the power of the annual flooding of the Nile to irrigate their lands gradually learning to regulate much of it through purposely built irrigation channels andcatchbasins The ancient Sumerians in Mesopotamia used a complex system of canals and levees to divert water from the Tigris and Euphrates rivers for irrigation"
"General Science & Technology","According to archaeologists the wheel was invented around BCE probably independently and nearly simultaneously in Mesopotamia in present day Iraq the Northern Caucasus Maykop culture and Central Europe Estimates on when this may have occurred range from to BCE with most experts putting it closer to BCE The oldest artifacts with drawings depicting wheeled carts date from about BCE however the wheel may have been in use for millennia before these drawings were made More recently the oldest known wooden wheel in the world was found in the Ljubljana marshes of Slovenia"
"General Science & Technology","The invention of the wheel revolutionized trade and war It did not take long to discover that wheeled wagons could be used to carry heavy loads The ancient Sumerians used the potter's wheel and may have invented it A stone pottery wheel found in the city state of Ur dates to around BCE and even older fragments of wheel thrown pottery have been found in the same area Fast rotary potters' wheels enabled early mass production of pottery but it was the use of the wheel as a transformer of energy through water wheels windmills and even treadmills that revolutionized the application of nonhuman power sources The first two wheeled carts were derived from travois and were first used in Mesopotamia and Iran in around BCE"
"General Science & Technology","The oldest known constructed roadways are the stone paved streets of the city state of Ur dating to circa BCE and timber roads leading through the swamps of Glastonbury England dating to around the same time period The first long distance road which came into use around BCE spanned miles from the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean Sea but was not paved and was only partially maintained In around BCE the Minoans on the Greek island of Crete built a fifty kilometer thirty mile road leading from the palace of Gortyn on the south side of the island through the mountains to the palace of Knossos on the north side of the island Unlike the earlier road the Minoan road was completely paved"
"General Science & Technology","Photograph of the Pont du Gard in France one of the most famous ancient Roman aqueducts"
"General Science & Technology","Ancient Minoan private homes had running water A bathtub virtually identical to modern ones was unearthed at the Palace of Knossos Several Minoan private homes also had toilets which could be flushed by pouring water down the drain The ancient Romans had many public flush toilets which emptied into an extensive sewage system The primary sewer in Rome was the Cloaca Maxima construction began on it in the sixth century BCE and it is still in use today"
"General Science & Technology","The ancient Romans also had a complex system of aqueducts which were used to transport water across long distances The first Roman aqueduct was built in BCE The eleventh and final ancient Roman aqueduct was built in CE Put together the Roman aqueducts extended over kilometers but less than seventy kilometers of this was above ground and supported by arches"

"General Science & Technology","Innovations continued through the Middle Ages with innovations such as silk the horse collar and horseshoes in the first few hundred years after the fall of the Roman Empire Medieval technology saw the use of simple machines such as the lever the screw and the pulley being combined to form more complicated tools such as the wheelbarrow windmills and clocks The Renaissance brought forth many of these innovations including the printing press which facilitated the greater communication of knowledge and technology became increasingly associated with science beginning a cycle of mutual advancement The advancements in technology in this era allowed a more steady supply of food followed by the wider availability of consumer goods"
"General Science & Technology","Starting in the United Kingdom in the th century the Industrial Revolution was a period of great technological discovery particularly in the areas of agriculture manufacturing mining metallurgy and transport driven by the discovery of steam power Technology took another step in a second industrial revolution with the harnessing of electricity to create such innovations as the electric motor light bulb and countless others Scientific advancement and the discovery of new concepts later allowed for powered flight and advancements in medicine chemistry physics and engineering The rise in technology has led to skyscrapers and broad urban areas whose inhabitants rely on motors to transport them and their food supply Communication was also greatly improved with the invention of the telegraph telephone radio and television The late th and early th centuries saw a revolution in transportation with the invention of the airplane and automobile"

"General Science & Technology","The th century brought a host of innovations In physics the discovery of nuclear fission has led to both nuclear weapons and nuclear power Computers were also invented and later miniaturized using transistors and integrated circuits Information technology subsequently led to the creation of the Internet which ushered in the current Information Age Humans have also been able to explore space with satellites later used for telecommunication and in manned missions going all the way to the moon In medicine this era brought innovations such as open heart surgery and later stem cell therapy along with new medications and treatments"
"General Science & Technology","Complex manufacturing and construction techniques and organizations are needed to make and maintain these new technologies and entire industries have arisen to support and develop succeeding generations of increasingly more complex tools Modern technology increasingly relies on training and education their designers builders maintainers and users often require sophisticated general and specific training Moreover these technologies have become so complex that entire fields have been created to support them including engineering medicine and computer science and other fields have been made more complex such as construction transportation and architecture"
"General Science & Technology","Generally technicism is the belief in the utility of technology for improving human societies Taken to an extreme technicismreflects a fundamental attitude which seeks to control reality to resolve all problems with the use of scientific–technological methods and toolsIn other words human beings will someday be able to master all problems and possibly even control the future using technology Some such as Stephen V Monsma connect these ideas to the abdication of religion as a higher moral authority"
"General Science & Technology","Optimistic assumptions are made by proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and singularitarianism which view technological development as generally having beneficial effects for the society and the human condition In these ideologies technological development is morally good"
"General Science & Technology","Transhumanists generally believe that the point of technology is to overcome barriers and that what we commonly refer to as the human condition is just another barrier to be surpassed"
"General Science & Technology","Singularitarians believe in some sort ofaccelerating change that the rate of technological progress accelerates as we obtain more technology and that this will culminate in aSingularityafter artificial general intelligence is invented in which progress is nearly infinite hence the term Estimates for the date of this Singularity vary but prominent futurist Ray Kurzweil estimates the Singularity will occur in"
"General Science & Technology","Kurzweil is also known for his history of the universe in six epochs the physical chemical epoch the life epoch the human brain epoch the technology epoch the artificial intelligence epoch and the universal colonization epoch Going from one epoch to the next is a Singularity in its own right and a period of speeding up precedes it Each epoch takes a shorter time which means the whole history of the universe is one giant Singularity event"
"General Science & Technology","Some critics see these ideologies as examples of scientism and techno utopianism and fear the notion of human enhancement and technological singularity which they support Some have described Karl Marx as a techno optimist"
"General Science & Technology","See also Luddite Neo Luddism Anarcho primitivism and Bioconservatism"
"General Science & Technology","On the somewhat skeptical side are certain philosophers like Herbert Marcuse and John Zerzan who believe that technological societies are inherently flawed They suggest that the inevitable result of such a society is to become evermore technological at the cost of freedom and psychological health"
"General Science & Technology","Many such as the Luddites and prominent philosopher Martin Heidegger hold serious although not entirely deterministic reservations about technology seeThe Question Concerning TechnologyAccording to Heidegger scholars Hubert Dreyfus and Charles Spinosa,Heidegger does not oppose technology He hopes to reveal the essence of technology in a way that 'in no way confines us to a stultified compulsion to push on blindly with technology or what comes to the same thing to rebel helplessly against it' Indeed he promises that 'when we once open ourselves expressly to the essence of technology we find ourselves unexpectedly taken into a freeing claim' What this entails is a more complex relationship to technology than either techno optimists or techno pessimists tend to allow"
"General Science & Technology","Some of the most poignant criticisms of technology are found in what are now considered to be dystopian literary classics such as Aldous Huxley's Brave New World Anthony Burgess's A Clockwork Orange and George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty Four In Goethe's Faust Faust selling his soul to the devil in return for power over the physical world is also often interpreted as a metaphor for the adoption of industrial technology More recently modern works of science fiction such as those by Philip K Dick and William Gibson and films such as Blade Runner and Ghost in the Shell project highly ambivalent or cautionary attitudes toward technology's impact on human society and identity"
"General Science & Technology","The late cultural critic Neil Postman distinguished tool using societies from technological societies and from what he calledtechnopolies"
"General Science & Technology","Darin Barney has written about technology's impact on practices of citizenship and democratic culture suggesting that technology can be construed as an object of political debate a means or medium of discussion and a setting for democratic deliberation and citizenship As a setting for democratic culture Barney suggests that technology tends to make ethical questions including the question of what a good life consists in nearly impossible because they already give an answer to the question a good life is one that includes the use of more and more technology"
"General Science & Technology","Nikolas Kompridis has also written about the dangers of new technology such as genetic engineering nanotechnology synthetic biology and robotics He warns that these technologies introduce unprecedented new challenges to human beings including the possibility of the permanent alteration of our biological nature These concerns are shared by other philosophers scientists and public intellectuals who have written about similar issues eg Francis Fukuyama Jürgen Habermas William Joy and Michael Sandel"
"General Science & Technology","Another prominent critic of technology is Hubert Dreyfus who has published books such as On the Internet and What Computers Still Can't Do"
"General Science & Technology","A more infamous anti technological treatise is Industrial Society and Its Future written by the Unabomber Ted Kaczynski and printed in several major newspapers and later books as part of an effort to end his bombing campaign of the techno industrial infrastructure There are also subcultures that disapprove of some or most technology such as self identified off gridders"
"General Science & Technology","The notion of appropriate technology was developed in the th century by thinkers such as EF Schumacher and Jacques Ellul to describe situations where it was not desirable to use very new technologies or those that required access to some centralized infrastructure or parts or skills imported from elsewhere The ecovillage movement emerged in part due to this concern"
"General Science & Technology","This section mainly focuses on American concerns even if it can reasonably be generalized to other Western countries"
"General Science & Technology","The inadequate quantity and quality of American jobs is one of the most fundamental economic challenges we face What's the linkage between technology and this fundamental problem "
"General Science & Technology","  Bernstein Jared,It’s Not a Skills Gap That’s Holding Wages Down It’s the Weak Economy Among Other Things"
"General Science & Technology","In his article Jared Bernstein a Senior Fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities questions the widespread idea that automation and more broadly technological advances have mainly contributed to this growing labor market problem His thesis appears to be a third way between optimism and skepticism Essentially he stands for a neutral approach of the linkage between technology and American issues concerning unemployment and declining wages"
"General Science & Technology","He uses two main arguments to defend his point First because of recent technological advances an increasing number of workers are losing their jobs Yet scientific evidence fails to clearly demonstrate that technology has displaced so many workers that it has created more problems than it has solved Indeed automation threatens repetitive jobs but higher end jobs are still necessary because they complement technology and manual jobs thatrequires flexibility judgment and common senseremain hard to replace with machines Second studies have not shown clear links between recent technology advances and the wage trends of the last decades"
"General Science & Technology","Therefore according to Bernstein instead of focusing on technology and its hypothetical influences on current American increasing unemployment and declining wages one needs to worry more aboutbad policy that fails to offset the imbalances in demand trade income and opportunity"
"General Science & Technology","For people who use both the Internet and mobile devices in excessive quantities it is likely for them to experience fatigue and over exhaustion as a result of disruptions in their sleeping patterns Continuous studies have shown that increased BMI and weight gain are associated with people who spend long hours online and not exercising frequently Heavy Internet use is also displayed in the school lower grades of those who use it in excessive amounts It has also been noted that the use of mobile phones whilst driving has increased the occurrence of road accidents   particularly amongst teen drivers Statistically teens reportedly have fourfold the number of road traffic incidents as those who are years or older and a very high percentage of adolescents write % and read % texts while driving In this context mass media and technology have a negative impact on people on both their mental and physical health"
"General Science & Technology","Thomas P Hughes stated that because technology has been considered as a key way to solve problems we need to be aware of its complex and varied characters to use it more efficiently What is the difference between a wheel or a compass and cooking machines such as an oven or a gas stove  Can we consider all of them only a part of them or none of them as technologies "
"General Science & Technology","Technology is often considered too narrowly according to Hughes,Technology is a creative process involving human ingenuityThis definition's emphasis on creativity avoids unbounded definitions that may mistakenly include cookingtechnologies"
"General Science & Technology","Yet because technology is everywhere and has dramatically changed landscapes and societies Hughes argues that engineers scientists and managers have often believed that they can use technology to shape the world as they want They have often supposed that technology is easily controllable and this assumption has to be thoroughly questioned For instance Evgeny Morozov particularly challenges two concepts Internet centrismandsolutionismInternet centrism refers to the idea that our society is convinced that the Internet is one of the most stable and coherent forces Solutionism is the ideology that every social issue can be solved thanks to technology and especially thanks to the internet In fact technology intrinsically contains uncertainties and limitations According to Alexis Madrigal's review of Morozov's theory to ignore it will lead tounexpected consequences that could eventually cause more damage than the problems they seek to addressBenjamin R Cohen and Gwen Ottinger also discussed the multivalent effects of technology"
"General Science & Technology","Therefore recognition of the limitations of technology and more broadly scientific knowledge is needed especially in cases dealing with environmental justice and health issues Ottinger continues this reasoning and argues that the ongoing recognition of the limitations of scientific knowledge goes hand in hand with scientists and engineers’ new comprehension of their role Such an approach of technology and sciencerequire technical professionals to conceive of their roles in the process differently They have to consider themselves as collaborators in research and problem solving rather than simply providers of information and technical solutions"

"General Science & Technology","This adult gorilla uses a branch as a walking stick to gauge the water's depth an example of technology usage by non human primates"
"General Science & Technology","The use of basic technology is also a feature of other animal species apart from humans These include primates such as chimpanzees some dolphin communities and crows Considering a more generic perspective of technology as ethology of active environmental conditioning and control we can also refer to animal examples such as beavers and their dams or bees and their honeycombs"
"General Science & Technology","The ability to make and use tools was once considered a defining characteristic of the genus Homo However the discovery of tool construction among chimpanzees and related primates has discarded the notion of the use of technology as unique to humans For example researchers have observed wild chimpanzees using tools for foraging some of the tools used include leaf sponges termite fishing probes pestles and levers West African chimpanzees also use stone hammers and anvils for cracking nuts as do capuchin monkeys of Boa Vista Brazil"
"General Science & Technology","Theories of technology often attempt to predict the future of technology based on the high technology and science of the time As with all predictions of the future however technology is uncertain"

"Enabling & Strategic Technologies","It would appear that living organisms are remarkably inefficient in the physical sense in their use of the energy they receive chemical or radiant energy and it is true that most real machines manage higher efficiencies In growing organisms the energy that is converted to heat serves a vital purpose as it allows the organism tissue to be highly ordered with regard to the molecules it is built from The second law of thermodynamics states that energy and matter tends to become more evenly spread out across the universe to concentrate energy or matter in one specific place it is necessary to spread out a greater amount of energy as heat across the remainder of the universethe surroundingsnote Simpler organisms can achieve higher energy efficiencies than more complex ones but the complex organisms can occupy ecological niches that are not available to their simpler brethren The conversion of a portion of the chemical energy to heat at each step in a metabolic pathway is the physical reason behind the pyramid of biomass observed in ecology to take just the first step in the food chain of the estimated Pg a of carbon that is fixed by photosynthesis Pg a % are used for the metabolism of green plants ie reconverted into carbon dioxide and heat"

"Built Environment & Design","When modern architecture was first practised it was an avant garde movement with moral philosophical and aesthetic underpinnings Immediately after World War I pioneering modernist architects sought to develop a completely new style appropriate for a new post war social and economic order focused on meeting the needs of the middle and working classes They rejected the architectural practice of the academic refinement of historical styles which served the rapidly declining aristocratic order The approach of the Modernist architects was to reduce buildings to pure forms removing historical references and ornament in favor of functional details Buildings displayed their functional and structural elements exposing steel beams and concrete surfaces instead of hiding them behind decorative forms Architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright developed organic architecture in which the form was defined by its environment and purpose with an aim to promote harmony between human habitation and the natural world with prime examples being Robie House and Fallingwater"
"Built Environment & Design","Architects such as Mies van der Rohe Philip Johnson and Marcel Breuer worked to create beauty based on the inherent qualities of building materials and modern construction techniques trading traditional historic forms for simplified geometric forms celebrating the new means and methods made possible by the Industrial Revolution including steel frame construction which gave birth to high rise superstructures Fazlur Rahman Khan's development of the tube structure was a technological break through in building ever higher By mid century Modernism had morphed into the International Style an aesthetic epitomized in many ways by the Twin Towers of New York's World Trade Center designed by Minoru Yamasaki"
"Built Environment & Design","Many architects resisted modernism finding it devoid of the decorative richness of historical styles As the first generation of modernists began to die after World War II the second generation of architects including Paul Rudolph Marcel Breuer and Eero Saarinen tried to expand the aesthetics of modernism with Brutalism buildings with expressive sculptural façades made of unfinished concrete But an even new younger postwar generation critiqued modernism and Brutalism for being too austere standardized monotone and not taking into account the richness of human experience offered in historical buildings across time and in different places and cultures"
"Built Environment & Design","One such reaction to the cold aesthetic of modernism and Brutalism is the school of metaphoric architecture which includes such things as biomorphism and zoomorphic architecture both using nature as the primary source of inspiration and design While it is considered by some to be merely an aspect of postmodernism others consider it to be a school in its own right and a later development of expressionist architecture"
"Built Environment & Design","Beginning in the late s and s architectural phenomenology emerged as an important movement in the early reaction against modernism with architects like Charles Moore in the United States Christian Norberg Schulz in Norway and Ernesto Nathan Rogers and Vittorio Gregotti Michele Valori Bruno Zevi in Italy who collectively popularized an interest in a new contemporary architecture aimed at expanding human experience using historical buildings as models and precedents Postmodernism produced a style that combined contemporary building technology and cheap materials with the aesthetics of older pre modern and non modern styles from high classical architecture to popular or vernacular regional building styles Robert Venturi famously defined postmodern architecture as adecorated shedan ordinary building which is functionally designed inside and embellished on the outside and upheld it against modernist and brutalistducksbuildings with unnecessarily expressive tectonic forms"
"Built Environment & Design","Since the s as the complexity of buildings began to increase in terms of structural systems services energy and technologies the field of architecture became multi disciplinary with specializations for each project type technological expertise or project delivery methods Moreover there has been an increased separation of the 'design' architect Notes from the 'project' architect who ensures that the project meets the required standards and deals with matters of liabilityNotes The preparatory processes for the design of any large building have become increasingly complicated and require preliminary studies of such matters as durability sustainability quality money and compliance with local laws A large structure can no longer be the design of one person but must be the work of many Modernism and Postmodernism have been criticised by some members of the architectural profession who feel that successful architecture is not a personal philosophical or aesthetic pursuit by individualists rather it has to consider everyday needs of people and use technology to create liveable environments with the design process being informed by studies of behavioral environmental and social sciences"
"Built Environment & Design","Environmental sustainability has become a mainstream issue with a profound effect on the architectural profession Many developers those who support the financing of buildings have become educated to encourage the facilitation of environmentally sustainable design rather than solutions based primarily on immediate cost Major examples of this can be found in passive solar building design greener roof designs biodegradable materials and more attention to a structure's energy usage This major shift in architecture has also changed architecture schools to focus more on the environment There has been an acceleration in the number of buildings that seek to meet green building sustainable design principles Sustainable practices that were at the core of vernacular architecture increasingly provide inspiration for environmentally and socially sustainable contemporary techniques The US Green Building Council's LEED Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design rating system has been instrumental in thisquantify"

"Built Environment & Design","Business architecture is the bridge between the enterprise business model and enterprise strategy on one side and the business functionality of the enterprise on the other side"
"Built Environment & Design","Cognitive architecture can refer to a theory about the structure of the human mind One of the main goals of a cognitive architecture is to summarize the various results of cognitive psychology in a comprehensive computer model However the results need to be in a formalized form so far that they can be the basis of a computer program The formalized models can be used to further refine a comprehensive theory of cognition and more immediately as a commercially usable model Successful cognitive architectures include ACT R Adaptive Control of Thought ACT and SOAR"
"Built Environment & Design","The Institute of Creative Technologies defines cognitive architecture as hypothesis about the fixed structures that provide a mind whether in natural or artificial systems and how they work together in conjunction with knowledge and skills embodied within the architecture to yield intelligent behavior in a diversity of complex environments"
"Built Environment & Design","In computer engineering,computer architectureis a set of rules and methods that describe the functionality organization and implementation of computer systems Some definitions of architecture define it as describing the capabilities and programming model of a computer but not a particular implementation In other definitions computer architecture involves instruction set architecture design microarchitecture design logic design and implementation"
"Built Environment & Design","Enterprise architecture EA isa well defined practice for conducting enterprise analysis design planning and implementation using a holistic approach at all times for the successful development and execution of strategy Enterprise architecture applies architecture principles and practices to guide organizations through the business information process and technology changes necessary to execute their strategies These practices utilize the various aspects of an enterprise to identify motivate and achieve these changes"
"Built Environment & Design","Practitioners of enterprise architecture enterprise architects are responsible for performing the analysis of business structure and processes and are often called upon to draw conclusions from the information collected to address the goals of enterprise architecture effectiveness efficiency agility and durability"
"Built Environment & Design","Interior architecture is the design of a space which has been created by structural boundaries and the human interaction within these boundaries It can also be the initial design and plan for use then later redesign to accommodate a changed purpose or a significantly revised design for adaptive reuse of the building shell The latter is often part of sustainable architecture practices conserving resources throughrecyclinga structure by adaptive redesign Generally referred to as the spatial art of environmental design form and practice interior architecture is the process through which the interiors of buildings are designed concerned with all aspects of the human uses of structural spaces Put simply interior architecture is the design of an interior in architectural terms"
"Built Environment & Design","Landscape architecture is the design of outdoor public areas landmarks and structures to achieve environmental social behavioral or aesthetic outcomes It involves the systematic investigation of existing social ecological and soil conditions and processes in the landscape and the design of interventions that will produce the desired outcome The scope of the profession includes landscape design site planning stormwater management environmental restoration parks and recreation planning visual resource management green infrastructure planning and provision and private estate and residence landscape master planning and design all at varying scales of design planning and management A practitioner in the profession of landscape architecture is called a landscape architect"

"Built Environment & Design","Network architecture is the design of a communication network It is a framework for the specification of a network's physical components and their functional organization and configuration its operational principles and procedures as well as data formats use In telecommunication the specification of a network architecture may also include a detailed description of products and services delivered via a communications network as well as detailed rate and billing structures under which services are compensated"
"Built Environment & Design","Software architecture refers to the fundamental structures of a software system the discipline of creating such structures and the documentation of these structures These structures are needed to reason about the software system Each structure comprises software elements relations among them and properties of both elements and relations along with rationale for the introduction and configuration of each element The architecture of a software system is a metaphor analogous to the architecture of a building"
"Built Environment & Design","Software architecture is about making fundamental structural choices that are costly to change once implemented Software architecture choices also called architectural decisions include specific structural options from possibilities in the design of software For example the systems that controlled the space shuttle launch vehicle had the requirement of being very fast and very reliable Therefore an appropriate real time computing language would need to be chosen Additionally to satisfy the need for reliability the choice could be made to have multiple redundant and independently produced copies of the program and to run these copies on independent hardware while cross checking results"
"Built Environment & Design","Documenting software architecture facilitates communication between stakeholders captures decisions about the architecture design and allows reuse of design components between projects –"
"Built Environment & Design","In distributed computing computations are distributed over different networked computers which communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages to one another Examples of architectures for distributed computing include high level architecture HLA and Distributed Interactive Simulation DIS"
"Built Environment & Design","System architecture is a conceptual model that defines the structure behavior and more views of a system An architecture description is a formal description and representation of a system organized in a way that supports reasoning about the structures and behaviors of the system A system architecture can comprise system components that will work together to implement the overall system There have been efforts to formalize languages to describe system architecture collectively these are called architecture description languages ADLs"
"Built Environment & Design","Urban design is the process of designing and shaping the physical features of cities towns and villages In contrast to architecture which focuses on the design of individual buildings urban design deals with the larger scale of groups of buildings streets and public spaces whole neighborhoods and districts and entire cities with the goal of making urban areas functional attractive and sustainable"
"Built Environment & Design","Urban design is an interdisciplinary field that utilizes elements of many built environment professions including landscape architecture urban planning architecture civil engineering and municipal engineering It is common for professionals in all these disciplines to practice urban design In more recent times different sub subfields of urban design have emerged such as strategic urban design landscape urbanism water sensitive urban design and sustainable urbanism"
"Built Environment & Design","A project architect is one who is responsible for ensuring the design is built correctly and who administers building contracts in non specialist architectural practices the project architect is also the design architect and the term refers to the differing roles the architect plays at differing stages of the process"

"Built Environment & Design","In the industrialized world construction usually involves the translation of designs into reality A formal design team may be assembled to plan the physical proceedings and to integrate those proceedings with the other parts The design usually consists of drawings and specifications usually prepared by a design team including architect civil engineers mechanical engineers electrical engineers structural engineers fire protection engineers planning consultants architectural consultants and archaeological consultants The design team is most commonly employed by ie in contract with the property owner Under this system once the design is completed by the design team a number of construction companies or construction management companies may then be asked to make a bid for the work either based directly on the design or on the basis of drawings and a bill of quantities provided by a quantity surveyor Following evaluation of bids the owner typically awards a contract to the most cost efficient bidder"
"Built Environment & Design","The best modern trend in design is toward integration of previously separated specialties especially among large firms In the past architects interior designers engineers developers construction managers and general contractors were more likely to be entirely separate companies even in the larger firms Presently a firm that is nominally anarchitectureorconstruction managementfirm may have experts from all related fields as employees or to have an associated company that provides each necessary skill Thus each such firm may offer itself asone stop shoppingfor a construction project from beginning to end This is designated as adesign buildcontract where the contractor is given a performance specification and must undertake the project from design to construction while adhering to the performance specifications"
"Built Environment & Design","Several project structures can assist the owner in this integration including design build partnering and construction management In general each of these project structures allows the owner to integrate the services of architects interior designers engineers and constructors throughout design and construction In response many companies are growing beyond traditional offerings of design or construction services alone and are placing more emphasis on establishing relationships with other necessary participants through the design build process"
"Built Environment & Design","The increasing complexity of construction projects creates the need for design professionals trained in all phases of the project's life cycle and develop an appreciation of the building as an advanced technological system requiring close integration of many sub systems and their individual components including sustainability Building engineering is an emerging discipline that attempts to meet this new challenge"
"Built Environment & Design","Construction projects can suffer from preventable financial problems Underbids happen when builders ask for too little money to complete the project Cash flow problems exist when the present amount of funding cannot cover the current costs for labour and materials and because they are a matter of having sufficient funds at a specific time can arise even when the overall total is enough Fraud is a problem in many fields but is notoriously prevalent in the construction field Financial planning for the project is intended to ensure that a solid plan with adequate safeguards and contingency plans are in place before the project is started and is required to ensure that the plan is properly executed over the life of the project"
"Built Environment & Design","Mortgage bankers accountants and cost engineers are likely participants in creating an overall plan for the financial management of the building construction project The presence of the mortgage banker is highly likely even in relatively small projects since the owner's equity in the property is the most obvious source of funding for a building project Accountants act to study the expected monetary flow over the life of the project and to monitor the payouts throughout the process Cost engineers and estimators apply expertise to relate the work and materials involved to a proper valuation Cost overruns with government projects have occurred when the contractor identified change orders or project changes that increased costs which are not subject to competition from other firms as they have already been eliminated from consideration after the initial bid"
"Built Environment & Design","Large projects can involve highly complex financial plans and often start with a conceptual estimate performed by a building estimator As portions of a project are completed they may be sold supplanting one lender or owner for another while the logistical requirements of having the right trades and materials available for each stage of the building construction project carries forward In many English speaking countries but not the United States projects typically use quantity surveyors"

"Built Environment & Design","A construction project is a complex net of contracts and other legal obligations each of which all parties must carefully consider A contract is the exchange of a set of obligations between two or more parties but it is not so simple a matter as trying to get the other side to agree to as much as possible in exchange for as little as possible The time element in construction means that a delay costs money and in cases of bottlenecks the delay can be extremely expensive Thus the contracts must be designed to ensure that each side is capable of performing the obligations set out Contracts that set out clear expectations and clear paths to accomplishing those expectations are far more likely to result in the project flowing smoothly whereas poorly drafted contracts lead to confusion and collapse"
"Built Environment & Design","Legal advisors in the beginning of a construction project seek to identify ambiguities and other potential sources of trouble in the contract structure and to present options for preventing problems Throughout the process of the project they work to avoid and resolve conflicts that arise In each case the lawyer facilitates an exchange of obligations that matches the reality of the project"
"Built Environment & Design","Design finance and legal aspects overlap and interrelate The design must be not only structurally sound and appropriate for the use and location but must also be financially possible to build and legal to use The financial structure must accommodate the need for building the design provided and must pay amounts that are legally owed The legal structure must integrate the design into the surrounding legal framework and enforce the financial consequences of the construction process"

"Communication & Textual Studies","The semantic study of meaning assumes that meaning is in a relation between signs and meanings that are firmly established through social convention However semantics does not study the way in which social conventions are made and affect language Rather when studying the way in which words and signs are used it is often the case that words have different meanings depending on the social context of use An important example of this is the process called deixis which describes the way in which certain words refer to entities through their relation between a specific point in time and space when the word is uttered Such words are for example the word,Iwhich designates the person speaking,nowwhich designates the moment of speaking andherewhich designates the position of speaking Signs also change their meanings over time as the conventions governing their usage gradually change The study of how the meaning of linguistic expressions changes depending on context is called pragmatics Deixis is an important part of the way that we use language to point out entities in the world Pragmatics is concerned with the ways in which language use is patterned and how these patterns contribute to meaning For example in all languages linguistic expressions can be used not just to transmit information but to perform actions Certain actions are made only through language but nonetheless have tangible effects eg the act ofnaming which creates a new name for some entity or the act ofpronouncing someone man and wife which creates a social contract of marriage These types of acts are called speech acts although they can also be carried out through writing or hand signing"

"Communication & Textual Studies","Languages differ widely in how much they rely on morphological processes of word formation In some languages for example Chinese there are no morphological processes and all grammatical information is encoded syntactically by forming strings of single words This type of morpho syntax is often called isolating or analytic because there is almost a full correspondence between a single word and a single aspect of meaning Most languages have words consisting of several morphemes but they vary in the degree to which morphemes are discrete units In many languages notably in most Indo European languages single morphemes may have several distinct meanings that cannot be analyzed into smaller segments For example in Latin the word bonus orgood consists of the root bon meaninggood and the suffix us which indicates masculine gender singular number and nominative case These languages are called fusional languages because several meanings may be fused into a single morpheme The opposite of fusional languages are agglutinative languages which construct words by stringing morphemes together in chains but with each morpheme as a discrete semantic unit An example of such a language is Turkish where for example the word evlerinizden orfrom your houses consists of the morphemes ev ler iniz den with the meanings house plural your from The languages that rely on morphology to the greatest extent are traditionally called polysynthetic languages They may express the equivalent of an entire English sentence in a single word For example in Persian the single word nafahmidamesh means I didn't understand it consisting of morphemes na fahm id am esh with the meanings,negationunderstandpastIitAs another example with more complexity in the Yupik word tuntussuqatarniksatengqiggtuq which meansHe had not yet said again that he was going to hunt reindeer the word consists of the morphemes tuntu ssur qatar ni ksaite ngqiggte uq with the meanings,reindeer hunt future say negation again thirdpersonsingularindicative and except for the morpheme tuntureindeernone of the other morphemes can appear in isolation"

"Communication & Textual Studies","In the th century AD the French Port Royal Grammarians developed the idea that the grammars of all languages were a reflection of the universal basics of thought and therefore that grammar was universal In the th century the first use of the comparative method by British philologist and expert on ancient India William Jones sparked the rise of comparative linguistics The scientific study of language was broadened from Indo European to language in general by Wilhelm von Humboldt Early in the th century Ferdinand de Saussure introduced the idea of language as a static system of interconnected units defined through the oppositions between them"
"Communication & Textual Studies","Linguists focusing on structure attempt to understand the rules regarding language use that native speakers know not always consciously All linguistic structures can be broken down into component parts that are combined according to subconscious rules over multiple levels of analysis For instance consider the structure of the wordtenthon two different levels of analysis On the level of internal word structure known as morphology the wordtenthis made up of one linguistic form indicating a number and another form indicating ordinality The rule governing the combination of these forms ensures that the ordinality markerthfollows the numbertenOn the level of sound structure known as phonology structural analysis shows that thensound intenthis made differently from thensound intenspoken alone Although most speakers of English are consciously aware of the rules governing internal structure of the word pieces oftenth they are less often aware of the rule governing its sound structure Linguists focused on structure find and analyze rules such as these which govern how native speakers use language"

"Communication & Textual Studies","Human languages also differ from animal communication systems in that they employ grammatical and semantic categories such as noun and verb present and past which may be used to express exceedingly complex meanings Human language is also unique in having the property of recursivity for example a noun phrase can contain another noun phrase as inthe chimpanzee's lipsor a clause can contain another clause as inI see the dog is runningHuman language is also the only known natural communication system whose adaptability may be referred to as modality independent This means that it can be used not only for communication through one channel or medium but through several For example spoken language uses the auditive modality whereas sign languages and writing use the visual modality and braille writing uses the tactile modality"

"Communication & Textual Studies","Language contact may also lead to a variety of other linguistic phenomena including language convergence borrowing and relexification replacement of much of the native vocabulary with that of another language In situations of extreme and sustained language contact it may lead to the formation of new mixed languages that cannot be considered to belong to a single language family One type of mixed language called pidgins occurs when adult speakers of two different languages interact on a regular basis but in a situation where neither group learns to speak the language of the other group fluently In such a case they will often construct a communication form that has traits of both languages but which has a simplified grammatical and phonological structure The language comes to contain mostly the grammatical and phonological categories that exist in both languages Pidgin languages are defined by not having any native speakers but only being spoken by people who have another language as their first language But if a Pidgin language becomes the main language of a speech community then eventually children will grow up learning the pidgin as their first language As the generation of child learners grow up the pidgin will often be seen to change its structure and acquire a greater degree of complexity This type of language is generally called a creole language An example of such mixed languages is Tok Pisin the official language of Papua New Guinea which originally arose as a Pidgin based on English and Austronesian languages others are Kreyòl ayisyen the French based creole language spoken in Haiti and Michif a mixed language of Canada based on the Native American language Cree and French"

"Communication & Textual Studies","Not all language contact situations result in the development of a pidgin or creole and researchers have studied the features of contact situations that make contact varieties more likely to develop Often these varieties arise in situations of colonization and enslavement where power imbalances prevent the contact groups from learning the other's language but sustained contact is nevertheless maintained The subjugated language in the power relationship is the substrate language while the dominant language serves as the superstrate Often the words and lexicon of a contact variety come from the superstrate making it the lexifier while grammatical structures come from the substrate but this is not always the case"

"Communication & Textual Studies","Communication systems used by other animals such as bees or apes are closed systems that consist of a finite usually very limited number of possible ideas that can be expressed In contrast human language is open ended and productive meaning that it allows humans to produce a vast range of utterances from a finite set of elements and to create new words and sentences This is possible because human language is based on a dual code in which a finite number of elements which are meaningless in themselves eg sounds letters or gestures can be combined to form an infinite number of larger units of meaning words and sentences However one study has demonstrated that an Australian bird the chestnut crowned babbler is capable of using the same acoustic elements in different arrangements to create two functionally distinct vocalizations Additionally pied babblers have demonstrated the ability to generate two functionally distinct vocalisations composed of the same sound type which can only be distinguished by the number of repeated elements"

"Communication & Textual Studies","Languages differ widely in how much they rely on morphological processes of word formation In some languages for example Chinese there are no morphological processes and all grammatical information is encoded syntactically by forming strings of single words This type of morpho syntax is often called isolating or analytic because there is almost a full correspondence between a single word and a single aspect of meaning Most languages have words consisting of several morphemes but they vary in the degree to which morphemes are discrete units In many languages notably in most Indo European languages single morphemes may have several distinct meanings that cannot be analyzed into smaller segments For example in Latin the word bonus orgood consists of the root bon meaninggood and the suffix us which indicates masculine gender singular number and nominative case These languages are called fusional languages because several meanings may be fused into a single morpheme The opposite of fusional languages are agglutinative languages which construct words by stringing morphemes together in chains but with each morpheme as a discrete semantic unit An example of such a language is Turkish where for example the word evlerinizden orfrom your houses consists of the morphemes ev ler iniz den with the meanings house plural your from The languages that rely on morphology to the greatest extent are traditionally called polysynthetic languages They may express the equivalent of an entire English sentence in a single word For example in Persian the single word nafahmidamesh means I didn't understand it consisting of morphemes na fahm id am esh with the meanings,negationunderstandpastIitAs another example with more complexity in the Yupik word tuntussuqatarniksatengqiggtuq which meansHe had not yet said again that he was going to hunt reindeer the word consists of the morphemes tuntu ssur qatar ni ksaite ngqiggte uq with the meanings,reindeer hunt future say negation again thirdpersonsingularindicative and except for the morpheme tuntureindeernone of the other morphemes can appear in isolation"

"Psychology & Cognitive Sciences","Developmental psychologists have a number of methods to study changes in individuals over time Common research methods include systematic observation including naturalistic observation or structured observation self reports which could be clinical interviews or structured interviews clinical or case study method and ethnography or participant observation These methods differ in the extent of control researchers impose on study conditions and how they construct ideas about which variables to study Every developmental investigation can be characterized in terms of whether its underlying strategy involves the experimental correlational or case study approach The experimental method involvesactual manipulation of various treatments circumstances or events to which the participant or subject is exposed the experimental design points to cause and effect relationships This method allows for strong inferences to be made of causal relationships between the manipulation of one or more independent variables and subsequent behavior as measured by the dependent variable The advantage of using this research method is that it permits determination of cause and effect relationships among variables On the other hand the limitation is that data obtained in an artificial environment may lack generalizability The correlational method explores the relationship between two or more events by gathering information about these variables without researcher intervention The advantage of using a correlational design is that it estimates the strength and direction of relationships among variables in the natural environment however the limitation is that it does not permit determination of cause and effect relationships among variables The case study approach allows investigations to obtain an in depth understanding of an individual participant by collecting data based on interviews structured questionnaires observations and test scores Each of these methods have its strengths and weaknesses but the experimental method when appropriate is the preferred method of developmental scientists because it provides a controlled situation and conclusions to be drawn about cause and effect relationships"

"Chemistry","In general polymeric mixtures are far less miscible than mixtures of small molecule materials This effect results from the fact that the driving force for mixing is usually entropy not interaction energy In other words miscible materials usually form a solution not because their interaction with each other is more favorable than their self interaction but because of an increase in entropy and hence free energy associated with increasing the amount of volume available to each component This increase in entropy scales with the number of particles or moles being mixed Since polymeric molecules are much larger and hence generally have much higher specific volumes than small molecules the number of molecules involved in a polymeric mixture is far smaller than the number in a small molecule mixture of equal volume The energetics of mixing on the other hand is comparable on a per volume basis for polymeric and small molecule mixtures This tends to increase the free energy of mixing for polymer solutions and thereby making solvation less favorable and thereby making the availability of concentrated solutions of polymers far rarer than those of small molecules"

"General Arts Humanities & Social Sciences","Positivist social scientists use methods resembling those of the natural sciences as tools for understanding society and so define science in its stricter modern sense Interpretivist social scientists by contrast may use social critique or symbolic interpretation rather than constructing empirically falsifiable theories and thus treat science in its broader sense In modern academic practice researchers are often eclectic using multiple methodologies for instance by combining both quantitative and qualitative research The termsocial researchhas also acquired a degree of autonomy as practitioners from various disciplines share in its aims and methods"
"General Arts Humanities & Social Sciences","The history of the social sciences begins in the Age of Enlightenment after which saw a revolution within natural philosophy changing the basic framework by which individuals understood what wasscientificSocial sciences came forth from the moral philosophy of the time and were influenced by the Age of Revolutions such as the Industrial Revolution and the French Revolution The social sciences developed from the sciences experimental and applied or the systematic knowledge bases or prescriptive practices relating to the social improvement of a group of interacting entities"
"General Arts Humanities & Social Sciences","The beginnings of the social sciences in the th century are reflected in the grand encyclopedia of Diderot with articles from Jean Jacques Rousseau and other pioneers The growth of the social sciences is also reflected in other specialized encyclopedias The modern period sawsocial sciencefirst used as a distinct conceptual field Social science was influenced by positivism focusing on knowledge based on actual positive sense experience and avoiding the negative metaphysical speculation was avoided Auguste Comte used the termscience socialeto describe the field taken from the ideas of Charles Fourier Comte also referred to the field as social physics"
"General Arts Humanities & Social Sciences","Following this period five paths of development sprang forth in the social sciences influenced by Comte in other fields One route that was taken was the rise of social research Large statistical surveys were undertaken in various parts of the United States and Europe Another route undertaken was initiated by Émile Durkheim studyingsocial facts and Vilfredo Pareto opening metatheoretical ideas and individual theories A third means developed arising from the methodological dichotomy present in which social phenomena were identified with and understood this was championed by figures such as Max Weber The fourth route taken based in economics was developed and furthered economic knowledge as a hard science The last path was the correlation of knowledge and social values the antipositivism and verstehen sociology of Max Weber firmly demanded this distinction In this route theory description and prescription were non overlapping formal discussions of a subject"
"General Arts Humanities & Social Sciences","Around the start of the th century Enlightenment philosophy was challenged in various quarters After the use of classical theories since the end of the scientific revolution various fields substituted mathematics studies for experimental studies and examining equations to build a theoretical structure The development of social science subfields became very quantitative in methodology The interdisciplinary and cross disciplinary nature of scientific inquiry into human behaviour social and environmental factors affecting it made many of the natural sciences interested in some aspects of social science methodology Examples of boundary blurring include emerging disciplines like social research of medicine sociobiology neuropsychology bioeconomics and the history and sociology of science Increasingly quantitative research and qualitative methods are being integrated in the study of human action and its implications and consequences In the first half of the th century statistics became a free standing discipline of applied mathematics Statistical methods were used confidently"

"General Arts Humanities & Social Sciences","For a topical guide to this subject see Outline of social science § Branches of social science"
"General Arts Humanities & Social Sciences","The following are problem areas and discipline branches within the social sciences"
"General Arts Humanities & Social Sciences","The social science disciplines are branches of knowledge taught and researched at the college or university level Social science disciplines are defined and recognized by the academic journals in which research is published and the learned social science societies and academic departments or faculties to which their practitioners belong Social science fields of study usually have several sub disciplines or branches and the distinguishing lines between these are often both arbitrary and ambiguous"
"General Arts Humanities & Social Sciences","Anthropology is the holisticscience of man a science of the totality of human existence The discipline deals with the integration of different aspects of the social sciences humanities and human biology In the twentieth century academic disciplines have often been institutionally divided into three broad domains The natural sciences seek to derive general laws through reproducible and verifiable experiments The humanities generally study local traditions through their history literature music and arts with an emphasis on understanding particular individuals events or eras The social sciences have generally attempted to develop scientific methods to understand social phenomena in a generalizable way though usually with methods distinct from those of the natural sciences"
"General Arts Humanities & Social Sciences","The anthropological social sciences often develop nuanced descriptions rather than the general laws derived in physics or chemistry or they may explain individual cases through more general principles as in many fields of psychology Anthropology like some fields of history does not easily fit into one of these categories and different branches of anthropology draw on one or more of these domains Within the United States anthropology is divided into four sub fields archaeology physical or biological anthropology anthropological linguistics and cultural anthropology It is an area that is offered at most undergraduate institutions The word anthropos ἄνθρωπος in Ancient Greek meanshuman beingorpersonEric Wolf described sociocultural anthropology asthe most scientific of the humanities and the most humanistic of the sciences"
"General Arts Humanities & Social Sciences","The goal of anthropology is to provide a holistic account of humans and human nature This means that though anthropologists generally specialize in only one sub field they always keep in mind the biological linguistic historic and cultural aspects of any problem Since anthropology arose as a science in Western societies that were complex and industrial a major trend within anthropology has been a methodological drive to study peoples in societies with more simple social organization sometimes calledprimitivein anthropological literature but without any connotation ofinferiorToday anthropologists use terms such asless complexsocieties or refer to specific modes of subsistence or production such aspastoralistorforagerorhorticulturalistto refer to humans living in non industrial non Western cultures such people or folk ethnos remaining of great interest within anthropology"
"General Arts Humanities & Social Sciences","The quest for holism leads most anthropologists to study a people in detail using biogenetic archaeological and linguistic data alongside direct observation of contemporary customs In the s and s calls for clarification of what constitutes a culture of how an observer knows where his or her own culture ends and another begins and other crucial topics in writing anthropology were heard It is possible to view all human cultures as part of one large evolving global culture These dynamic relationships between what can be observed on the ground as opposed to what can be observed by compiling many local observations remain fundamental in any kind of anthropology whether cultural biological linguistic or archaeological"

"General Arts Humanities & Social Sciences","Communication studies deals with processes of human communication commonly defined as the sharing of symbols to create meaning The discipline encompasses a range of topics from face to face conversation to mass media outlets such as television broadcasting Communication studies also examines how messages are interpreted through the political cultural economic and social dimensions of their contexts Communication is institutionalized under many different names at different universities includingcommunication communication studies speech communication rhetorical studies communication science media studies communication arts mass communication media ecology andcommunication and media science"
"General Arts Humanities & Social Sciences","Communication studies integrates aspects of both social sciences and the humanities As a social science the discipline often overlaps with sociology psychology anthropology biology political science economics and public policy among others From a humanities perspective communication is concerned with rhetoric and persuasion traditional graduate programs in communication studies trace their history to the rhetoricians of Ancient Greece The field applies to outside disciplines as well including engineering architecture mathematics and information science"

"General Arts Humanities & Social Sciences","Buyers bargain for good prices while sellers put forth their best front in Chichicastenango Market Guatemala"
"General Arts Humanities & Social Sciences","Economics has two broad branches microeconomics where the unit of analysis is the individual agent such as a household or firm and macroeconomics where the unit of analysis is an economy as a whole Another division of the subject distinguishes positive economics which seeks to predict and explain economic phenomena from normative economics which orders choices and actions by some criterion such orderings necessarily involve subjective value judgments Since the early part of the th century economics has focused largely on measurable quantities employing both theoretical models and empirical analysis Quantitative models however can be traced as far back as the physiocratic school Economic reasoning has been increasingly applied in recent decades to other social situations such as politics law psychology history religion marriage and family life and other social interactions This paradigm crucially assumes that resources are scarce because they are not sufficient to satisfy all wants and thateconomic valueis willingness to pay as revealed for instance by market arms' length transactions Rival heterodox schools of thought such as institutional economics green economics Marxist economics and economic sociology make other grounding assumptions For example Marxist economics assumes that economics primarily deals with the investigation of exchange value of which human labour is the source"

"General Arts Humanities & Social Sciences","Geography as a discipline can be split broadly into two main sub fields human geography and physical geography The former focuses largely on the built environment and how space is created viewed and managed by humans as well as the influence humans have on the space they occupy This may involve cultural geography transportation health military operations and cities The latter examines the natural environment and how the climate vegetation and life soil oceans water and landforms are produced and interact Physical geography examines phenomena related to the measurement of earth As a result of the two subfields using different approaches a third field has emerged which is environmental geography Environmental geography combines physical and human geography and looks at the interactions between the environment and humans Other branches of geography include social geography regional geography and geomatics"
"General Arts Humanities & Social Sciences","Geographers attempt to understand the Earth in terms of physical and spatial relationships The first geographers focused on the science of mapmaking and finding ways to precisely project the surface of the earth In this sense geography bridges some gaps between the natural sciences and social sciences Historical geography is often taught in a college in a unified Department of Geography"
"General Arts Humanities & Social Sciences","Modern geography is an all encompassing discipline closely related to GISc that seeks to understand humanity and its natural environment The fields of urban planning regional science and planetology are closely related to geography Practitioners of geography use many technologies and methods to collect data such as GIS remote sensing aerial photography statistics and global positioning systems GPS"

"General Arts Humanities & Social Sciences","The social science of law jurisprudence in common parlance means a rule that unlike a rule of ethics is capable of enforcement through institutions However many laws are based on norms accepted by a community and thus have an ethical foundation The study of law crosses the boundaries between the social sciences and humanities depending on one's view of research into its objectives and effects Law is not always enforceable especially in the international relations context It has been defined as asystem of rules as aninterpretive conceptto achieve justice as anauthorityto mediate people's interests and even asthe command of a sovereign backed by the threat of a sanctionHowever one likes to think of law it is a completely central social institution Legal policy incorporates the practical manifestation of thinking from almost every social science and the humanities Laws are politics because politicians create them Law is philosophy because moral and ethical persuasions shape their ideas Law tells many of history's stories because statutes case law and codifications build up over time And law is economics because any rule about contract tort property law labour law company law and many more can have long lasting effects on the distribution of wealth The noun law derives from the late Old English lagu meaning something laid down or fixed and the adjective legal comes from the Latin word lex"
"General Arts Humanities & Social Sciences","Ferdinand de Saussure recognized as the father of modern linguistics"
"General Arts Humanities & Social Sciences","Linguistics investigates the cognitive and social aspects of human language The field is divided into areas that focus on aspects of the linguistic signal such as syntax the study of the rules that govern the structure of sentences semantics the study of meaning morphology the study of the structure of words phonetics the study of speech sounds and phonology the study of the abstract sound system of a particular language however work in areas like evolutionary linguistics the study of the origins and evolution of language and psycholinguistics the study of psychological factors in human language cut across these divisions"
"General Arts Humanities & Social Sciences","The overwhelming majority of modern research in linguistics takes a predominantly synchronic perspective focusing on language at a particular point in time and a great deal of it partly owing to the influence of Noam Chomsky aims at formulating theories of the cognitive processing of language However language does not exist in a vacuum or only in the brain and approaches like contact linguistics creole studies discourse analysis social interactional linguistics and sociolinguistics explore language in its social context Sociolinguistics often makes use of traditional quantitative analysis and statistics in investigating the frequency of features while some disciplines like contact linguistics focus on qualitative analysis While certain areas of linguistics can thus be understood as clearly falling within the social sciences other areas like acoustic phonetics and neurolinguistics draw on the natural sciences Linguistics draws only secondarily on the humanities which played a rather greater role in linguistic inquiry in the th and early th centuries Ferdinand Saussure is considered the father of modern linguistics"

"General Arts Humanities & Social Sciences","Psychology is an academic and applied field involving the study of behaviour and mental processes Psychology also refers to the application of such knowledge to various spheres of human activity including problems of individuals' daily lives and the treatment of mental illness The word psychology comes from the Ancient Greek ψυχή psychesoul mindand logystudy"
"General Arts Humanities & Social Sciences","Psychology differs from anthropology economics political science and sociology in seeking to capture explanatory generalizations about the mental function and overt behaviour of individuals while the other disciplines focus on creating descriptive generalizations about the functioning of social groups or situation specific human behaviour In practice however there is quite a lot of cross fertilization that takes place among the various fields Psychology differs from biology and neuroscience in that it is primarily concerned with the interaction of mental processes and behaviour and of the overall processes of a system and not simply the biological or neural processes themselves though the subfield of neuropsychology combines the study of the actual neural processes with the study of the mental effects they have subjectively produced Many people associate psychology with clinical psychology which focuses on assessment and treatment of problems in living and psychopathology In reality psychology has myriad specialties including social psychology developmental psychology cognitive psychology educational psychology industrial organizational psychology mathematical psychology neuropsychology and quantitative analysis of behaviour"
"General Arts Humanities & Social Sciences","Psychology is a very broad science that is rarely tackled as a whole major block Although some subfields encompass a natural science base and a social science application others can be clearly distinguished as having little to do with the social sciences or having a lot to do with the social sciences For example biological psychology is considered a natural science with a social scientific application as is clinical medicine social and occupational psychology are generally speaking purely social sciences whereas neuropsychology is a natural science that lacks application out of the scientific tradition entirely In British universities emphasis on what tenet of psychology a student has studied and or concentrated is communicated through the degree conferred BPsy indicates a balance between natural and social sciences BSc indicates a strong or entire scientific concentration whereas a BA underlines a majority of social science credits This is not always necessarily the case however and in many UK institutions students studying the BPsy BSc and BA follow the same curriculum as outlined by The British Psychological Society and have the same options of specialism open to them regardless of whether they choose a balance a heavy science basis or heavy social science basis to their degree If they applied to read the BA for example but specialized in heavily science based modules then they will still generally be awarded the BA"
"General Arts Humanities & Social Sciences","Émile Durkheim is considered one of the founding fathers of sociology"
"General Arts Humanities & Social Sciences","Sociology is the systematic study of society individuals' relationship to their societies the consequences of difference and other aspects of human social action The meaning of the word comes from the suffix logy which meansstudy of derived from Ancient Greek and the stemsoci which is from the Latin word socius meaningcompanion or society in general"

"General Arts Humanities & Social Sciences","Karl Marx rejected Comte's positivism but nevertheless aimed to establish a science of society based on historical materialism becoming recognized as a founding figure of sociology posthumously as the term gained broader meaning Around the start of the th century the first wave of German sociologists including Max Weber and Georg Simmel developed sociological antipositivism The field may be broadly recognized as an amalgam of three modes of social thought in particular Durkheimian positivism and structural functionalism Marxist historical materialism and conflict theory and Weberian antipositivism and verstehen analysis American sociology broadly arose on a separate trajectory with little Marxist influence an emphasis on rigorous experimental methodology and a closer association with pragmatism and social psychology In the s the Chicago school developed symbolic interactionism Meanwhile in the s the Frankfurt School pioneered the idea of critical theory an interdisciplinary form of Marxist sociology drawing upon thinkers as diverse as Sigmund Freud and Friedrich Nietzsche Critical theory would take on something of a life of its own after World War II influencing literary criticism and the Birmingham School establishment of cultural studies"
"General Arts Humanities & Social Sciences","Sociology evolved as an academic response to the challenges of modernity such as industrialization urbanization secularization and a perceived process of enveloping rationalization The field generally concerns the social rules and processes that bind and separate people not only as individuals but as members of associations groups communities and institutions and includes the examination of the organization and development of human social life The sociological field of interest ranges from the analysis of short contacts between anonymous individuals on the street to the study of global social processes In the terms of sociologists Peter L Berger and Thomas Luckmann social scientists seek an understanding of the Social Construction of Reality Most sociologists work in one or more subfields One useful way to describe the discipline is as a cluster of sub fields that examine different dimensions of society For example social stratification studies inequality and class structure demography studies changes in a population size or type criminology examines criminal behaviour and deviance and political sociology studies the interaction between society and state"

"General Arts Humanities & Social Sciences","In contemporary usage,social researchis a relatively autonomous term encompassing the work of practitioners from various disciplines that share in its aims and methods Social scientists employ a range of methods in order to analyse a vast breadth of social phenomena from census survey data derived from millions of individuals to the in depth analysis of a single agent's social experiences from monitoring what is happening on contemporary streets to the investigation of ancient historical documents The methods originally rooted in classical sociology and statistical mathematics have formed the basis for research in other disciplines such as political science media studies and marketing and market research"
"General Arts Humanities & Social Sciences","Social research methods may be divided into two broad schools"
"General Arts Humanities & Social Sciences","Quantitative designs approach social phenomena through quantifiable evidence and often rely on statistical analysis of many cases or across intentionally designed treatments in an experiment to create valid and reliable general claims"
"General Arts Humanities & Social Sciences","Qualitative designs emphasize understanding of social phenomena through direct observation communication with participants or analysis of texts and may stress contextual and subjective accuracy over generality"
"General Arts Humanities & Social Sciences","Social scientists will commonly combine quantitative and qualitative approaches as part of a multi strategy design Questionnaires field based data collection archival database information and laboratory based data collections are some of the measurement techniques used It is noted the importance of measurement and analysis focusing on the difficult to achieve goal of objective research or statistical hypothesis testing A mathematical model uses mathematical language to describe a system The process of developing a mathematical model is termed 'mathematical modelling' also modeling Eykhoff defined a mathematical model as 'a representation of the essential aspects of an existing system or a system to be constructed that presents knowledge of that system in usable form' Mathematical models can take many forms including but not limited to dynamical systems statistical models differential equations or game theoretic models"
"General Arts Humanities & Social Sciences","These and other types of models can overlap with a given model involving a variety of abstract structures The system is a set of interacting or interdependent entities real or abstract forming an integrated whole The concept of an integrated whole can also be stated in terms of a system embodying a set of relationships that are differentiated from relationships of the set to other elements and from relationships between an element of the set and elements not a part of the relational regime A dynamical system modeled as a mathematical formalization has a fixedrulethat describes the time dependence of a point's position in its ambient space Small changes in the state of the system correspond to small changes in the numbers The evolution rule of the dynamical system is a fixed rule that describes what future states follow from the current state The rule is deterministic for a given time interval only one future state follows from the current state"
"General Arts Humanities & Social Sciences","Social scientists often conduct Program Evaluation which is a systematic method for collecting analyzing and using information to answer questions about projects policies and programs particularly about their effectiveness and efficiency In both the public and private sectors stakeholders often want to know whether the programs they are funding implementing voting for receiving or objecting to are producing the intended effect While program evaluation first focuses around this definition important considerations often include how much the program costs per participant how the program could be improved whether the program is worthwhile whether there are better alternatives if there are unintended outcomes and whether the program goals are appropriate and useful"
"General Arts Humanities & Social Sciences","Other social scientists emphasize the subjective nature of research These writers share social theory perspectives that include various types of the following"
"General Arts Humanities & Social Sciences","Critical theory is the examination and critique of society and culture drawing from knowledge across social sciences and humanities disciplines"
"General Arts Humanities & Social Sciences","Dialectical materialism is the philosophy of Karl Marx which he formulated by taking the dialectic of Hegel and joining it to the materialism of Feuerbach"
"General Arts Humanities & Social Sciences","Feminist theory is the extension of feminism into theoretical or philosophical discourse it aims to understand the nature of gender inequality"
"General Arts Humanities & Social Sciences","Marxist theories such as revolutionary theory and class theory cover work in philosophy that is strongly influenced by Karl Marx's materialist approach to theory or is written by Marxists"
"General Arts Humanities & Social Sciences","Phronetic social science is a theory and methodology for doing social science focusing on ethics and political power based on a contemporary interpretation of Aristotelian phronesis"
"General Arts Humanities & Social Sciences","Post colonial theory is a reaction to the cultural legacy of colonialism"
"General Arts Humanities & Social Sciences","Postmodernism refers to a point of departure for works of literature drama architecture cinema and design as well as in marketing and business and in the interpretation of history law culture and religion in the late th century"
"General Arts Humanities & Social Sciences","Rational choice theory is a framework for understanding and often formally modeling social and economic behaviour"
"General Arts Humanities & Social Sciences","Social constructionism considers how social phenomena develop in social contexts"
"General Arts Humanities & Social Sciences","Structuralism is an approach to the human sciences that attempts to analyze a specific field for instance mythology as a complex system of interrelated parts"
"General Arts Humanities & Social Sciences","Structural functionalism is a sociological paradigm that addresses what social functions various elements of the social system perform in regard to the entire system"
"General Arts Humanities & Social Sciences","Other fringe social scientists delve in alternative nature of research These writers share social theory perspectives that include various types of the following"
"General Arts Humanities & Social Sciences","Intellectual critical ism describes a sentiment of critique towards or evaluation of intellectuals and intellectual pursuits"
"General Arts Humanities & Social Sciences","Scientific criticalism is a position critical of science and the scientific method"
"General Arts Humanities & Social Sciences","Most universities offer degrees in social science fields The Bachelor of Social Science is a degree targeted at the social sciences in particular it is often more flexible and in depth than other degrees that include social science subjectsa"
"General Arts Humanities & Social Sciences","In the United States a university may offer a student who studies a social sciences field a Bachelor of Arts degree particularly if the field is within one of the traditional liberal arts such as history or a BSc Bachelor of Science degree such as those given by the London School of Economics as the social sciences constitute one of the two main branches of science the other being the natural sciences In addition some institutions have degrees for a particular social science such as the Bachelor of Economics degree though such specialized degrees are relatively rare in the United States"
"General Arts Humanities & Social Sciences","Graduate students may get a Master's degree Master of Arts Master of Science or a field specific degree such as Master of Public Administration or PhD"
"General Arts Humanities & Social Sciences","The social sciences receive less funding than the natural sciences It has been estimated that only % of all funding for climate related research is spent on the social science of climate change mitigation Vastly more funding is spent on natural science studies of climate change and considerable sums are also spent on studies of impact of and adaptation to climate change It has been argued that this is a misallocation of resources as the most urgent puzzle at the current juncture is to work out how to change human behavior to mitigate climate change whereas the natural science of climate change is already well established and there will be decades and centuries to handle adaptation"
"General Arts Humanities & Social Sciences","A Bachelor of Social Science degree can be earned at the University of Adelaide University of Waikato Hamilton New Zealand University of Sydney University of New South Wales University of Hong Kong University of Manchester Lincoln University New Zealand National University of Malaysia and University of Queensland"
