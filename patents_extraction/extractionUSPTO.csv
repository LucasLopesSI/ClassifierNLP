The router and methods are implemented with a dynamic link state routing protocol (DLSP). The router dynamically computes a best path from one or more paths by periodically probing links of peer nodes to determine link metrics associated with a link. The one or more link metrics include a link bandwidth to a peer node and a link latency to the peer node. Further, the router can dynamically recalculate the one or more link metrics associated with the link every 10 seconds. The router can also monitor one or more link state changes based on the one or more link metrics, wherein the link state changes are monitored every 60 second. The router can further determine a single link metric based on the link bandwidth to the peer node and the link latency to the peer node.","ADARA NETWORKS, INC.",US,"PCT International Search Report for PCT/US2018/050765 dated Nov. 30, 2018. cited by applicant .

Injection rates can be monotonically increased to a maximum level (e.g., as defined by physical constraints of the system) and then monotonically decreased to a lower level, allowing the injection rates to be monotonically increased again. While injection rates are monotonically increasing, viscous fingering between the injection fluid and hydrocarbons can be minimized while the hydrocarbons in the formation are displaced. While injection rates are monotonically decreasing, creation of new viscous fingers can be minimized while the injection rates are decreased to levels suitable for the monotonic increasing phase of a subsequent monotonic cycle.","Halliburton Energy Services, Inc.",US,"Dias et al., Minimization of Viscous Fluid Fingering: A Variational Scheme for Optimal Flow Rates, Phys Rev Lett., vol. 109, 2012, pp. 1-5. cited by applicant .

In one preferred embodiment of the present invention, the process of separating and purifying a fermentation product from a fermenter off-gas, containing the fermentation product, volatile impurities, bio-byproduct impurities and water, comprises the steps of: (a) compressing the fermenter off-gas and feeding it into a membrane module, and (b) selectively permeating the volatile impurities, bio-byproduct impurities and water through the membrane, resulting in a product rich retentate stream. The fermentation gas product is separated from the fermenter off-gas in a single membrane stage to produce a purified retentate stream. In accordance with this embodiment of the invention, the fermenter off-gas (2), comprising the fermentation gas product, volatile impurities, bio-byproduct impurities and water, passes through a blower (201) that transports it to a gas holder (202), in order to smooth the process fluctuations. Stream (11) exits the gas holder (202) and is compressed in a multi-stage compressor (203), from which bio-byproduct and water are removed through stream (4). The compressed stream (12) enters the membrane module (204), which permeates the volatile impurities, disposing them in stream (13).

An electromagnetic signal that crosses the device is confined in the interior of the defects, due to the photonic band gap associated with the periodic structure that surrounds it. Its main function is the control of the flux of an electromagnetic signal over a communication channel, blocking (state off) or allowing (state on) the passage of the signal. It also promotes the change in the propagation direction of an electromagnetic signal by an angle of 120 degrees, providing greater flexibility in the design of integrated optical systems. The working principle of the device is based on the excitation of dipole modes in its resonant cavity, accordingly to the application of an external DC magnetic field on the magneto-optical material that constitutes it.

The combinator includes a number of series-connected combinator stages and the differentiator includes a number of series-connected differentiator stages. The CCD filter functions similarly to an interpolator filter, filtering and up-sampling the baseband signal out of the baseband. In one embodiment, the up-sampling factor is twice the number of channels (2N). The disclosed DUC does not require complex mixers or oscillators. Also, the low-pass filter of the DUC does not require a narrow transition band, so the number of coefficients for the low-pass filter is relatively low.","NXP USA, Inc.",US,"Cui, X., et al., ""Design and Implementation of Digital Up Converter for Homenet""; 2005 IEEE Conference on Electron Devices and Solid-State Circuits; DOI: 10.1109/EDSSC.2005.1635382; Date of Conference: Dec. 19-21, 2005. cited by applicant .

For example, an encoder is configured to encode point cloud data, thereby producing encoded data. In particular, the encoder applies a region-adaptive hierarchical transform (""RAHT"") to attributes of occupied points, thereby producing transform coefficients. The encoder can also quantize the transform coefficients and perform adaptive entropy coding of the quantized transform coefficients. For corresponding decoding, a decoder is configured to decode the encoded data to reconstruct point cloud data. In particular, the decoder applies an inverse RAHT to transform coefficients for attributes of occupied points. The decoder can also perform adaptive entropy decoding and inverse quantization of the quantized transform coefficients. The adaptive entropy coding/decoding can use estimates of the distribution of values for the quantized transform coefficients. In this case, the encoder calculates the estimates and signals them to the decoder.","Microsoft Technology Licensing, LLC",US,"Ahn et al., ""Motion-compensated Compression of 3D Animation Models,"" Journal of Electronics Letters, vol. 37, No. 24, pp. 1445-1446 (Nov. 2001). cited by applicant .

A coordinator node then prioritizes replica nodes based on the received status of the other nodes and sends query requests to those nodes based on the prioritization. Should a node fail to provide an response to a query request, further query requests are sent to a next highest priority replica node containing the relevant data.

Such methods may be particularly useful when interpreting large sets of data, such as DAS VSP data collected during hydrocarbon recovery operations. The methods generally involve identifying data channels affected by noise from a DAS data set, and then interpolating from the surrounding data. This may improve the quality of the resulting downsampled data, with respect to the signal to noise ratio, compared to what would have occurred by merely decimating unwanted data channels. In addition, a priori information about channel fading, the desired downsampling rate, and the slowest expected elastic waves may be used to filter the DAS data.

The results of the invention are considered to be very promising, since both constructs can induce T-cell response against the same epitopes induced by the 17DD vaccine, and the pL/YFE construct can also induce a satisfactory concentration of neutralizing antibodies.

Owing to the existence of the photonic band gap, an electromagnetic signal propagating through the device is confined within the guides and the cavity and, through the adjustment of the orientation of a dipole mode generated within the cavity, is able to function in three distinct regimes. In regime 1, subjected to an external DC magnetic field +H0, it functions as a two-way divider, with isolation of the input relative to the two outputs, and, upon reversal of the field signal, it functions as an optical key. In regime 2, with the use of a DC magnetic field -H0, it functions as a waveguide bender, with the input isolated from the output, and, upon reversal of the field signal, functions as an optical key. In regime 3, subject to the application of an external DC magnetic field +H1, the device functions as a three-way divider.",UNIVERSIDADE FEDERAL DO PARA-UFPA,BR,No other references field

The RRA method comprises two phases: Unconstrained Maximization and Reallocation. In the Unconstrained Maximization phase, frequency resources are iteratively allocated to mobile terminals in an opportunistic way, obeying the exclusivity and adjacency constraints but without concern for the minimum service requirement constraint; the resulting allocation is tested for fulfillment of the minimum service requirement constraint; and one or more mobile terminals are removed from the allocation based on the minimum service requirement constraint test.

In many cases, these disturbances cause unscheduled production stops, and in others may damage equipment such as heat exchangers. Thus slugging may have a major impact on the reliability of the operation, as it may affect product availability and quality (BSW, TOG and Moisture). Therefore, there is a complex control problem to use measurements to dynamically act on the production choke valves to set a new type of flow, without major slugging. The purpose of this invention is to provide an Advanced Automated Control System for minimizing slugging that can quickly act to avoid this type of flow as well as protect the process equipment. This system is comprised of sensors, valves and numerous PID or ONFC type controllers using aggregate computer algorithms to monitor a set of operating variables that enable diagnosing and controlling production well slugging.

It also has the function of changing the propagation direction of an electromagnetic signal by an angle of 60 degrees, offering greater flexibility in the design of integrated optical systems. The operating principle of the device is associated with the excitation of dipole modes in the resonant cavity, which is based on a magneto-optical material. When the switch is under the influence of an external DC magnetic field H.sub.0, a rotating dipole mode excited in the cavity allows the passage of the input signal to the output (state on), whereas without the application of H.sub.0, a stationary dipole mode excited in the cavity, with the nodes aligned to the output waveguide, prevents the passage of the input signal to the output (state off).",UNIVERSIDADE FEDERAL DO PARA--UFPA,BR,No other references field

The plurality of nanostructures may be provided such that their long axes are substantially aligned and, in some cases, continuous from end to end of the sample. For example, in some cases, the nanostructures may be fabricated by uniformly growing the nanostructures on the surface of a substrate, such that the long axes are aligned and non-parallel to the substrate surface. The nanostructures may be, in some instances, substantially perpendicular to the substrate surface. In one set of embodiments, a force with a component normal to the long axes of the nanostructures may be applied to the substantially aligned nanostructures. The application of a force may result in a material comprising a relatively high volume fraction or mass density of nanostructures. In some instances, the application of a force may result in a material comprising relatively closely-spaced nanostructures. The materials described herein may be further processed for use in various applications, such as composite materials (e.g., nanocomposites).

If the MMU determines that the PTE does not include a mapping from a virtual address to a physical address, then the MMU responds to the request based on the sparse status. If the sparse status is active, then the MMU determines the physical address based on whether the type of the request is a write operation and, subsequently, generates an acknowledgement of the request.

An agent server is interconnected with the automatic call distributor (ACD) and agent telephones of the contact center. The server intercepts messages sent by the ACD, which contain caller-provided data obtained by an interactive voice response system. When it is determined that the particular agent has access to both a telephone and a personal computer, the agent server draws a distinction in the information content of the received message. In doing so, the agent server provides the call initialization information in the message to the agent's telephone, and appears as if the information were coming from the ACD; additionally, the agent server provides the caller-provided data to the agent's personal computer.

The system can control operation of ice removers (e.g., blades or heaters), which are mounted within the wheel wells forward of the wheel, based on information received from the vehicle's outside temperature sensor and anti-lock braking system (ABS). When the temperature sensor indicates that the outside temperature is below a predetermined temperature and when the anti-lock braking system is activated as a result of detected skid, a controller activates the ice remover in one or more of the wheel wells and, thereby cause the ice remover to remove ice from the road surface forward of the corresponding wheel.

A prediction method is also optionally previously applied, so that residual values with shorter lengths are compressed instead of the original values. An alignment compression technique exploits repetition patterns in the floating point numbers when they are aligned to the same exponent.

The method involves applying separately to the pile two different compositions. When separate the two compositions are low viscosity and easy to spray. When combined the two form a gel coating that is resistant to erosion but is flexible while the pile or payload is still settling, jostling, being bumped, and otherwise moving around. This coating is especially effective for coal piles, iron ore piles, and also for piles within and/or being moved by open topped railroad cars. The coating's flexibility prevents the coating from becoming brittle and shattering. The coating has better performance than its ingredients do alone. As a result the invention can both prevent unwanted dust pollution as well as save its users money by avoiding loss of blown away material.",Ecolab USA Inc.,US,"Abstracts of RU 2303700, Jul. 2007. cited by examiner."

Thus, for pure water the tension (.PSI.) is equal to the potential (T) and given by T=-2.sigma./[L tg(.alpha.)], wherein .sigma. is the water surface tension. In order to measure water tension in the soil, the system is coupled to porous elements, while the sensor edge is pressed directly against roots and other plant organs. Water potential, instead, is measured with the edge positioned at a few micrometers from the sample and the response takes place after the exchange of a few picoliters of water, when the condition of balance of temperature and water vapor is approached. Visually, with a sliding gauge, one measures water tensions between zero and 0.3 MPa, while with the aid of a microscope the reading extends up to 3.0 MPa.

This ontology and set of axioms may be used to create the knowledgebase of an artificially intelligent expert system that emulates the business operations. A processor parses a representation of business processes stored in the business-process model, deriving a set of axioms and a set of entity classes from the parsed data. The processor uses these axioms and classes to identify concept nodes and process nodes, which it organizes into the ontology of the knowledgebase. The processor further identifies information derived from the parsed data to create a set of triple data items, each of which represents the information represented by one or more of the derived axioms. These triples are stored in the knowledgebase as a triple store data structure.",International Business Machines Corporation,US,"Maedche, Alexander, et al, ""The Ontology Extraction & Maintenance Framework Text-To-Onto"" Proceedings of the ICDM'01 Workshop on Integrating Data Mining and Knowledge Management, 2001. cited by examiner .

The inverter includes a circuit breaker that when it receives an external signal to activate the auxiliary power supply indicating that the auxiliary supply should be connected, the circuit breaker enables the auxiliary power supply, which activates the inverter. The inverter begins sending, continually, the internal maintenance signal to activate the auxiliary supply to the circuit breaker indicating that the auxiliary supply should be kept running, making the circuit breaker maintain the auxiliary power supply enabled. When the circuit breaker receives an external deactivation signal from the auxiliary supply indicating that the auxiliary supply should be disconnected, the inverter stops sending the signal to maintain the auxiliary supply activated to the circuit breaker, and the circuit breaker disables the auxiliary power supply, deactivating the inverter.",Whirlpool S.A.,BR,No other references field
